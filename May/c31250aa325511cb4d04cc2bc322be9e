Petrol prices have been on an sharp increase since Januar 2021 . FILE PHOTO | NMG The revelation that the Treasury compensated oil dealers Sh1.05 billion from the Petroleum Development Fund is worrying since its regulations are not ready. The State promised to pay the marketers to keep fuel prices unchanged in the monthly review to stem possible outrage. While there is a need to cushion the public from exorbitant fuel prices without causing financial distress to marketers, the State cannot manipulate prices every time there is an increase in global prices. Apart from the international costs, the State has control over the other price elements — taxes. There are at least nine related taxes and levies. The tax levied on a litre comes to around 45 percent and 16 percent VAT. It appears the State is not serious about protecting Kenyans and businesses from economic pressures. If it was, why is the fuel subsidy that was introduced in July last year yet to be implemented, despite having raised nearly Sh15 billion? It is not even clear how the subsidy plan will work. Does the State have ulterior motives with the funds? It is time to review the fuel pricing formula.
