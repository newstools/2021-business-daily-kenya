The Aquaculture Academy, which is an initiative of FoodTechAfrica, will train fish farmers, investors, teachers, extension workers, agrovets and other stakeholders to run sustainable and profitable businesses. The academy comprises a 21-member consortium of companies from Netherlands and Kenya as well as governments and knowledge institutions whose goal is to unlock potential of aquaculture industry in Kenya. “Aquaculture farms are underperforming resulting in losses which are causing farmers and investors to lose interest in the industry, “This hampers the sector from adequately contributing to the economy through creation of jobs and playing its role in meeting Kenya’s food security challenges,” said Julie Muyela, Associate Director Lattice, the company steering the FoodTechAfrica consortium. Aquaculture is the breeding, rearing, and harvesting of fish, shellfish, algae, and other organisms in all types of water environments. Students from across Kenya and East Africa will be able to follow practical courses in the academy that are accredited by their universities and vocational institutes. “Our aim is to implement a business-oriented training program that will build aquaprenuers of all levels across the value chain,” Ms Muyela stated.
