Kenya Medical Supplies Authority offices, Industrial Area, Nairobi. FILE PHOTO | NMG The Kenya Medical Supplies Authority’s (Kemsa) search for culture change experts for openness and leadership amid the cloud of scandals must be embraced by all within the State-run firm. This crucial agency has faced a string of damning scandals that has plagued its operations and change is the only way out to regain trust and revamp its public image. The firm has pledged to reform its corporate culture, seen by experts as a factor that facilitated the cheating and theft, and become a more transparent business. But the uphill task of learning from past mistakes and introducing change can only work if managers and all staff embrace the transformation. Anything short of this goal will amount to a window dressing and a waste of taxpayers’ money. The agency must ensure that the process is taken seriously so that it doesn’t end up as just a knee-jerk reaction to calm the taxpayer’s wrath. Many organisations that have emerged from such low moments had to take difficult decisions such as letting go of employees not willing to embrace modern management practices. Millions depend on sound functioning of this agency and the new board must not squander this opportunity.
