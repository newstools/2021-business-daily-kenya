Kenya Medical Supplies Authority offices, Industrial Area, Nairobi. FILE PHOTO | NMG The Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (Kemsa) is seeking to hire culture change experts in a bid to reform the agency and improve accountability of its employees amid a string of damning scandals that have plagued the agency. The Kemsa has issued a tender for culture change experts to execute reforms at the agency as part of a campaign to regain trust and revamp it's public image following the questionable and inflated Sh7.8 billion Covid-19 supplies tenders now under inquiry in which billions might have been misappropriated or stolen. Kemsa is seen to borrow from modern management practices which have seen corporates turn to external culture change experts to instill accountability among employees after major scandals. German auto maker Volkswagen eyed changing its culture after the scandal surrounding cheating on diesel engine emission tests. "The Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (Kemsa) has set aside funds for use in the procurement of Culture Change Management Program Services during the Financial Year 2020-2021. It is intended that part of the proceeds of the funds will be used to cover eligible payments under contract for Provision of Culture Change Management Program Services," said Kemsa in internal documents seen by Business Daily. "Kemsa now invites sealed bids from eligible Consultants for the Provision of Culture Change Management Program Services." President Uhuru Kenyatta overhauled the entire Kemsa Board of Directors on April 29, in the wake of multi-billion-shilling scandals plaguing the medical supplies agency. Mary Chao Mwadime took over from former board chairman Kembi Gitura, who was moved to Communications Authority (CA) on March 17, 2021.
