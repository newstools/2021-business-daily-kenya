Thirteen former senior Kenya Power executives have been awarded a sum of Sh135 million in total by the Labour Court as compesation for retrenchment that happened six years ago. The money amounting to Sh135,298,934 is payment for constructive redundancy package of two months’ salary for each year worked. Justice Maureen Onyango arrived at the figure after doing a computation as per the judgement issued in February 2020 by Justice Hellen Wasilwa where the court found the former employees were entitled to be paid a redundancy package after being retrenched. In that judgment the former employees are named as Raphael Njoroge Mwaura, Samuel Migwi Theuri, Mary Waeni Wambua, Anne Elizabeth Owuor, Charles Lwanga Ooko, Charles Thinwa Mathenge, Cleophas Simiyu Wekesa and Florence Kirimania Obura. Others are Godfrey Kigarie Gathige, James Ngugi Njuguna, Joshua Kamau Mwangi, Nathaniel Waithaka Wanyagi and Samuel Njoroge Njogu. They lost their jobs in 2015 after Kenya Power declared them redundant following a reorganisation of the company's management. The utility firm offered a voluntary early retirement plan to those who had not secured placements in the new structure. Placed in the position they were, having just lost their positions, the 13 employees chose to apply for the Voluntary Early Retirement (VER). In its judgment the court noted the fact that the VER targeted those in “senior management” and with a deadline of five days to make the application, pressure was mounted upon the targeted staff.
