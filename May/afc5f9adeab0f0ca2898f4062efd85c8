Pallet Cafe in Nairobi’s Gigiri Close is an illustration of how you do not need money to build amazing things, just imagination. It is built squarely around the theme of pallet boxes. They are seats, they are bars, they are beds, they are the soul of the place. The difference between this Pallet Cafe in Gigiri and their other branch in Lavington is that this one serves alcohol —which makes it the best cafe, for me at least. But to be fair to the Pallet Cafe in Lavington, it has a resident tortoise. That should count for something, surely. What Feizal (owner) did is he rented out this massive old house not too far from the US Embassy. It has a lush garden and I saw squirrels and a monkey going about their business). They make cheese at the back. The verandah is propped by massive pillars reminiscent of the old Roman Empire architecture. He turned the living room into a very suave space full of pallets, art and African fabric. There is art on the walls on sale by African artists. The rooms will be turned into little shops, one of them a clothesline. From another room, a studio of sorts, emerged a gung-ho dreadlocked chap who introduced himself as Fadhili the musician. He was cradling a guitar like you would a newborn baby. Every Sunday from 3pm to 6pm, a different artist holds court in the garden. That Sunday an artist called Idd Aziz was scheduled to play. Over a drink, Fadhili talked passionately about African music and its history and why we need to know it. His music is informed greatly by a man called George Mukabi who sung the song “mtoto si nguo, utaomba mtu” in the 50s. He died under a hail of machetes from his band of irate brothers-in-law. Fadhili has tonnes of stories of African music, something the tortoise in Lavington cannot beat.
