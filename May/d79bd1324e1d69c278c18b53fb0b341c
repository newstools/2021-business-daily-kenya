The Sh5.8 billion project, which involves re-carpeting and upgrading of the roads to cabro and asphalt (bitumen) standard, was launched in November last year but contractors commenced the works this January. The project also involves installation of additional walkways and cycle lanes where adequate space is available. Already, a total of 57.2km of access roads have been constructed across the more than 12 informal settlements. According to data by Kura, 5.3km has been done in Mukuru, another 18.6km in Dagarotti, 10.8km in Kawangware, 2.1km in Kangemi, 1.7km in Kibera and 1.2km in Korogocho. Another 23.5km has been upgraded in Dandora, Utawala, Mihang’o and Ruai areas, 10.9km in Kasarani, 17.8km in Githurai, 7.7km in Roysambu and 1.5km in Mathare. Kura Director General Silas Kinoti said the project is progressing according to plan despite Covid-19 pandemic and rains. He said the project will be a game changer in the slums which have suffered from poor road network making accessibility of critical services and other essentials a challenge as it will open up the slums connecting them with other parts of Nairobi. The lack of accessibility in the areas have presented difficulties during emergency and disaster responses including fire outbreaks, among others. “The project is progressing according to plan with the completion date being November, 2022. Challenges have been minimal despite Covid-19 and rains,” said Mr Kinoti. “Through this project, the government is bringing back dignity, sanity to the slums. If you have been in the slums you will know how setting up access roads is almost impossible due to lack of space,” he added.
