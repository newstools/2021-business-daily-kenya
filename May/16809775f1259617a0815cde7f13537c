Typically the report is released in late April or early May and was to capture economic conditions in year a when Kenya imposed restrictions like travel ban, night curfew, closure of schools and night clubs to curb coronavirus. Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) director-general Macdonald Obudho said on Thursday the delay in releasing the Economic Survey 2021 was due to late submission of data by some of respondents in economic sectors. “The bureau acknowledges the role of our users in providing invaluable feedback to our production processes and look forward to the same engagement during this period,” Mr Odudho said in a statement, while publicly apologising for the delay. “The report will be disseminated at the earliest opportunity once the process is completed.” The KNBS also delayed to release the GDP data for second and third quarter of last year. The report for second quarter was released on October 15 as opposed to the typical September 30, while that for third quarter was published January 27, this year, as opposed to December 31st.
