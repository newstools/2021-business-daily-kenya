President Uhuru Kenyatta announced the new visa policy on Wednesday during a meeting of Kenyan and Tanzanian business leaders in Nairobi, also attended by the visiting Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu. The freedom to work in any of the East African Community (EAC) partner countries is an integral part of the Common Market Protocol that was ratified in 2010. The implementation has been delayed for over a decade and Wednesday’s announcement could fast-track its implementation. President Kenyatta said the move would allow Tanzanians to enter the country without restrictions and work freely, attracting foreign investment and boosting tourism without compromising national security. Now that Kenya has gone ahead to lift all restrictions blocking Tanzanians from applying for opportunities and working in the country, it is our hope that the neighbouring country will reciprocate. This should be followed by commitment from other member states to enable East Africans realise the benefits of integration.
