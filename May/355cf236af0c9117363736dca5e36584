Groundnuts. A study revealed that Turkana is excellent for groundnut production because of its virgin lands. FILE PHOTO | NMG Refugees in Turkana County will benefit from Sh160 million groundnuts project by a United Nations agency aimed at empowering them economically and cut reliance on relief. The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has launched the Refugee Agricultural Value Chains for Economic Self Reliance (Raves) project to be implemented in the County. The project, whose implementation has already begun in Turkana West, will focus on Kalobeyei refugee settlement and is projected to benefit 9,000 people with an estimated gross income of Sh267 million over a period of four years. It is funded by a Dutch based IKEA Foundation, which identified groundnut value chain as a potential crop for sustainable income generation as well as nutrition security for both the host and refugee community. “Agriculture is undoubtedly the key driver in transforming the lives and livelihoods of refugee and host communities in Turkana County. We are honored to begin this initiative to create a viable agribusiness initiative that is demand driven,” said FAO Representative to Kenya Carla Mucavi. The project will be implemented in collaboration with Turkana County Government, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), INSTA Products Ltd, World Food Programme (WFP), Egerton University, and International Finance Corporation. The first seed trials conducted in partnership with Egerton University in early 2020 revealed that Turkana is excellent for groundnut production because of its virgin lands. The trials also revealed that the nuts produced in this region are free from cancer causing aflatoxin.
