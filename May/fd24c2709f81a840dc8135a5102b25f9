The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) has ordered for arrest and prosecution of three West Pokot former senior county officials and a businesswoman over alleged irregular procurement of 5,000 bags of maize worth Sh18 million. Mr Solomon Merireng (Chief Officer Finance), Mike Parklea (County Secretary), Alice Chepkosgei (Procurement Officer) and Margret Jesang Tuitoeck (Director of M/S Lilian Enterprise Ltd) are accused of flouting procurement procedures in the purchase of the grains during the 2017/2018 financial year. The anti-graft detectives had earlier arrested the accused and arraigned before Anti-Corruption Court in Eldoret but they were released on cash bail. “The EACC submitted the investigation report to DPP and upon review concurred with recommendations to arrest and charge the suspects,” stated the report by the anti-graft body. The four face charges of failure to comply with procurement procedures and guidelines and making false documents and are to be arraigned before Anti-Corruption Court in Eldoret to answer the charges. According to the documents, Dr Parklea and Ms Chepkosgei committed additional offences.
