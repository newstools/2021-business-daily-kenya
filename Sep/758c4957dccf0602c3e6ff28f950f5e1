Moi International Airport manager Peter Wafula said at least five aircraft were diverted before mid-morning. Some of the planes that landed in Mombasa include Egypt Air from Dar es Salaam, Jambojet, two Kenya Airways flights from Accra and Lagos. Mr Wafula said more flights would be diverted if the weather conditions in Nairobi persist. He said a Jambojet plane that left Mombasa for Nairobi had to turn back.
