Buffalos at Nairobi National Park. FILE PHOTO | NMG The sharp wildlife populations decline at the Nairobi National Park due to human encroachment is alarming and calls for urgent action. With the National Wildlife Census 2021 report showing that the populations have dropped by up to 70 percent, we don’t have the luxury of time, certainly not when the count of animals such as warthogs and waterbucks is down to double digits. The biggest attraction for park is its being the only one of its kind in the world that is within a capital city. Every year it draws big numbers of international visitors out to see the Big Five animals during their stay in Nairobi. But with the fast falling animal populations at the park, there may be no Big Five to see in a few years. With human settlements blocking most wildlife migratory routes, the numbers could decline even further. To avert further encroachment we should start by incentivising the surrounding communities to keep the migratory corridors open by sharing the tourism proceeds. This is especially crucial for the few remaining open migratory routes in Kapiti and Kitengela. The State should develop policy to ensure controlled development near the migratory corridors.
