The government has established the National Intelligence and Research University College that will identify, admit and train qualified students drawn from the intelligence community. The new institution will be a constituent college of the National Defence University- Kenya, which received a charter in May 27, 2021. “There is established a university college to be known as the National Intelligence and Research University College which shall be a constituent college of the National Defence University- Kenya,” George Magoha, the Education Cabinet Secretary, said in a gazette notice dated June 11, 2021. The specialised institution will train individual learners and the intelligence community. “The status accorded to the University College by this Order as a constituent college of National Defence University-Kenya, shall be transitional only,” Prof Magoha said. He said the University College may initiate the necessary administrative and legal measures to ensure that it becomes a fully-fledged University with the approval of the National Security Council.
