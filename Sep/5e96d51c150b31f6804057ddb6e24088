A majority of refugees into the country and asylum seekers come from Somalia, followed by South Sudanese, Congolese, and Ethiopians in that order. According to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) persons of concern from other nationalities including Sudan, Rwanda, Eritrea, Burundi, Uganda, and others make up 6.8 percent of the total population. The survey also pointed out that the child and adult refugee population increased marginally from 267,908 and 221,839 in 2019 to 270,245 and 234,609, respectively, in 2020. Almost half of the refugees in Kenya (44 percent) reside in Dadaab in Garissa County, 40 percent in Kakuma in Turkana, and 16 percent in urban areas, mainly Nairobi, alongside 18,500 stateless persons. “Political developments and the humanitarian situation in the region will continue to impact upon the Kenya Operation in 2020, mainly as a result of the situations in the two countries; Somalia and South Sudan, but also the ongoing unrest in Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC),” UHNCR says. Between December 2014 and December 2019, the UN helped send back Somalis who agreed to voluntarily return to their country after peace was restored in neighbouring country. In 2016, Kenya also announced plans to close Dadaab camps and disband the Department for Refugee Affairs (DRA) citing security, environmental and economic burdens.
