Kisumu International Airport. FILE PHOTO | NMG The cost of domestic flight on the Nairobi-Kisumu route has slightly dropped on increased competition among carriers, a move set to offer a major boost to travellers on the route. Aviation firm Renegade Air Limited is currently charging a one-month promotional fare of Sh4,600 on a one-way air ticket – down from Sh5,000 when it resumed operation on the route in August. The airline that also plans to start direct Nairobi-Homabay flights next month has so far not added additional flights on the route that it serves four times per day. “The reduced fares is part of our promotion for the week days to bring the numbers,” the airline's sales and marketing manager Patrick Oketch told the Business Daily in an interview yesterday. Aviation firm 748 that started its operations on the route in May has also slightly cut its fares on the route. The airline was on September 6 charging Sh5,350 to carry passengers from Nairobi to Kisumu in the morning. It was also charging Sh4, 000 on the same day to ferry passengers between the two destinations on its evening flight. When it launched its operations on the route, the airline was charging passengers an average fare of Sh10,700 on a return air ticket – which is relatively lower compared to its competitors on the route. Safarilink which is one of the longest serving carriers on the Kisumu route has kept it fares at Sh4,600 over the week (Monday-Saturday). The fares have been slightly increased to Sh5, 999 on Sundays. “It’s a delicate balancing act. So many airlines have made a debut on the Nairobi–Kisumu route. Their biggest headache is pricing and they must get it right,” said a source at the Kenya Airports Authority.
