The Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) data released Thursday shows that the passenger and cargo trains generated Sh11.3 billion last year, down from Sh14.7 billion in 2019. The cargo trains accounted for the biggest chunk of the revenue in the year at Sh10.4 billion, representing 92 percent of the earnings while the passenger service posted Sh896 million. The pandemic hit the logistics sector including public transport and the long-haul transits hard following the imposed night curfew and restrictions of movement in and out of Nairobi metropolitan area, Mombasa, Kilifi, Kwale and Mandera. The restrictions were lifted in May. The cargo service remained in operation to support flow of goods through the Mombasa port. “This decline is on account of discounts and promotional rates introduced following the commencement of Mombasa-Naivasha SGR cargo services,” reads the KNBS report released Thursday.
