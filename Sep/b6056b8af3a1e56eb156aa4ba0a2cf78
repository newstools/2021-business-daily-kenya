The Economic Survey 2021 released Thursday shows that the sector’s gross domestic product stood at Sh518.5 billion in 2020, compared to Sh463.63 billion in the previous year. Some of the Government’s major projects include the Sh65 billion Jkia-Westlands Expressway through a public-private partnership (PPP) model, Sh3 billion facelift of Kisumu port, and the construction of Lamu port under the ambitious Sh2.5 trillion Lamu Port-South Sudan-Ethiopia Transport (Lapsset) corridor project. “The construction sector’s growth was largely buoyed by the continued investment in public infrastructure during the review period as evidenced by a sharp increase in demand for construction materials. The accelerated growth was further supported by ongoing rehabilitation of the Metre Gauge Railway (MGR),” the KNBS Economic Survey shows. The government is also constructing Sh3.6 billion housing units through the State Department of Housing. As a result, the value of public residential buildings increased by Sh7.6 billion last year from Sh1.5 billion in 2019.
