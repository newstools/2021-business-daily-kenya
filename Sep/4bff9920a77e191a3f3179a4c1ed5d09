The parties involved in a dispute on the distribution of the Sh30 million estate of former President Daniel arap Moi’s eldest son, Jonathan Kipkemboi Moi, have been granted more time by the court to file their witness statements. Family division deputy registrar Wandia Nyamu Monday granted the five parties up to December 1, 2021 when the case will be mentioned before the trial judge Aggrrey Muchelule. When the case was called Monday to confirm the filing of statements on objections raised by two widows of Jonathan and fixing of a hearing date, the registrar heard that all documents had not been filed. The objections by Beatrice Mbuli, and Faith Nyambura are in relation to an earlier court order that granted Jonathan’s first wife, Sylvia Cherotich, temporary rights to administer his estate. The two argue that they were sidelined from seeking a piece of Jonathan’s wealth, arguing that they were married to him through traditional ceremonies. They accused Sylvia of concealing material facts and leaving them out as beneficiaries of the estate. At the time of his death on April 20, 2019, Jonathan had not prepared a will, a lacuna that has now set the stage for what could turn out to be another protracted succession battle involving the country's prominent families. The main parties in the succession dispute are Jonathan's three widows -Sylvia, Beatrice Mbuli, Faith Nyambura- creditors, and another beneficiary named Collins Moi.
