KenInvest managing director Moses Ikiara. PHOTO | FILE The Kenya Investment Authority (KenInvest) is seeking to hire a managing director, ending the eight-year reign of Moses Ikiara. KenInvest on Wednesday morning advertised the vacancy, saying that interested candidates should apply before October 25. The announcement marks the end of Mr Ikiara’s two-term tenure at the government’s investment arm and comes at a time the State has stepped up efforts to attract foreign investors and create jobs. KenInvest is drafting legal changes that will see deep-pocketed foreign investors — whose enterprises have a high impact on creating new jobs and exports earnings — eligible to get second citizenship in Kenya without meeting the current stringent requirements to qualify. The agency sees this as a magnet for growing foreign direct investment (FDI) flows. “The authority is seeking to recruit a suitable candidate for the position of a Managing Director,” KenInvest said in the notice. Mr Ikiara’s successor will serve for a four-year term, renewable once subject to satisfactory performance. Mr Ikiara joined KenInvest in February 2013.
