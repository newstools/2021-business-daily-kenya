Among 85 leaders from the arid and semi-arid lands (ASAL) who met with Mr Kenyatta were five governors, Cabinet Secretaries, chief administrative secretaries, principal secretaries, MPs and senators. “The President has instructed the National Treasury and the Ministry of Interior to spearhead government efforts to assist affected households including water and relief food distribution as well as livestock update,” Kanze Dena Mararo, the President’s spokesperson, said in a statement.
