The world’s third largest shipping container company after Maersk Line and Mediterranean Shipping Company, is set to increase its fleet to serve Mombasa and newly constructed Lamu port, as well as offer sea time training to BMA learners. CMA CMG East African cluster managing director Jean-Baptiste Longin termed the signing of the memorandum will boost trade between Kenya and France. “This is a historic cooperation that will enable us to support further development of Kenya’s shipping and maritime sector and take advantage of the expertise of our global shipping line for further blue growth in Kenya,” said Mr Longin. Speaking in Mombasa while inspecting various ongoing projects at the port, the MD said the agreement will give cadets opportunities and help in developing shore-based shipping and port operations skills. “As a start to this collaboration, the French container and shipping company will be providing seaboard training to a minimum of four cadets and four laureates from BMA in maritime transport and logistics in July 2021,” said Mr Longin.
