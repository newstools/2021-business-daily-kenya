A Danish international container shipping company, Maersk Line, and the third largest shipping company, CMA CGM have announced a number of changes to serve Mombasa and Lamu ports. Maersk, the world’s largest shipping company on Monday stated that it is enhancing the service it offers from Mombasa to North Europe, specifically Felixstowe and Rotterdam, by providing a single transhipment product via Salalah. Maersk Eastern Africa managing director Carl Lorenz in a statement said the changes in network are primarily aimed at providing higher predictability and offering more flexibility to customers’ supply chains. Mr Lorenz said redesigning the network from Salalah, the ME7 service will bring more resilience to customers’ supply chains, further protecting them from operational challenges that arise out of contingencies. “We welcome the redesign of our ocean network from Salalah which will connect our Kenyan customers cargo to Europe through a single transhipment. This ocean product enhancement will ensure further peace of mind to Kenyan exporters injecting more resilience, predictability, and reliability into our customers’ supply chains, particularly essential for perishable cargo from Kenya,” said the director. “It’s great to see this important market being prioritised where global reliability in Ocean Freight is more of a challenge than ever. “
