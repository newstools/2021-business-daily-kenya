The first outlet will be opened at Mega Plaza in Kisumu’s central business district this month in a space previously occupied by Tuskys. The second outlet will be located at United Mall along the busy Kisumu-Kakamega highway, opening its doors to the public in August. The upcoming stores will raise the retailer’s branch network across the country to 15 amid an aggressive expansion by rivals Naivas and Quickmart. “Market Mega and the United Mall — will open in July and August respectively,” said Franck Moreau, country manager of Carrefour Kenya in a statement yesterday. “The opening of the two stores will raise the total number of Carrefour outlets in Kenya to 15, including 11 stores in Nairobi and 2 in Mombasa.” The two branches in Kisumu come barely a few months after Tuskys ceased operations at the outlet on dwindling cash flows. The retailer has been expanding its presence in Kenya taking over spaces previously occupied by supermarket chains that have ceased operations, including Shoprite, Nakumatt and Uchumi, as well as opening new outlets. Carrefour Kenya sales rose 28 percent to Sh18.7 billion last year compared to Sh14.8 billion in 2018, indicating that its aggressive expansion bid was paying off.
