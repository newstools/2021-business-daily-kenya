A Quality Control Officer collects samples of maize for checking of the moisture content and aflatoxin testing. FILE PHOTO | POOL The State released Sh100 million maize stocks that the Kenya Bureau of Standards (Kebs) condemned as unfit for human use, exposing consumers to cancer on unacceptable levels of aflatoxin. It is baffling how government agencies can disagree on something as crucial as human food and health that leave thousands of consumers at risk of contracting a deadly disease. Such confusion is undesirable and untenable since, going forward, people will doubt the government, pushing them to gamble with their lives. While the Kebs condemned 176,225 bags, Public Health and the National Cereals and Produce Board jointly cleared a sample of 51,640 bags into the market. According to the WHO, high levels of aflatoxin cause acute poisoning that can damage the liver. This is a bigger damage than selling the stocks at a throw-away price. We ask the authorities to reduce such confusion and run a concrete assessment to ascertain where the truth lies. After running the audit, those found culpable should be punished to serve as a warning to the rest.
