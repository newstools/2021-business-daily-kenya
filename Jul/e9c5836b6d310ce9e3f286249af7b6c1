The bar at Emara Ole Sereni is as luxurious as the clientele EABL is targeting. Designed by local firm Timber World, it creates an inviting atmosphere exuding glamor and intimacy. Joel Kamau, commercial director at Kenya Breweries Limited, EABL’s subsidiary, said they picked Emara Ole Sereni for its scenery offering that includes the Nairobi National Park and epic sunsets that will make for great sundowner cocktails. “It isn’t just the bar next door, it is the swankiest rooftop bar in Nairobi with screaming exclusivity with a dash of attitude,” he said during the launch. Yvonne Mwangi, head of Nairobi sales said that the bar is a high-energy lounge that EABL hopes will attract their Johnnie Walker consumers from this city and beyond. “The need to reach every consumer is inspired by Johnnie Walker himself: 200 years ago, he was determined his whisky would be carried by every ship’s captain, ‘from the four corners of Scotland to the four corners of the world’. We are pleased to accomplish one of our forefather’s wishes today,” she said. “It is, therefore, a perfect fit for our brand since it will drive the intended aspiration,” she added about the bar. EABL business integrity director Alan Muguma said that the firm inked a four-year partnership with Emara Ole Sereni. “We believe that a well-invested bar, run by innovative and experienced operators will bring people together from all walks of life. Emara by Ole-Sereni, matches the global standard for Tanqueray brand, and they are associated with the aspiration that our brands stand for,” he said.
