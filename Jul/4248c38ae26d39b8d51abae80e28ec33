The Nairobi Coffee Exchange (NCE) will start trading coffee from regional countries to boost its revenue and increase productivity, Agriculture Cabinet secretary Peter Munya has said. The minister said he is pushing for a proposal through the Coffee Bill that is currently before Parliament to have NCE allowed to trade regional produce. Mr Munya said Uganda has over the years been wanting to trade its coffee through Nairobi, but current laws do not allow for such an arrangement. “We want the auction to start trading coffees from other countries in the region and we want to add that proposal in the current Coffee Bill,” he said. The minister said the auction would benefit from more volumes coming in from Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda and Burundi, creating an opportunity to increase its income and enhance services. The exchange is looking to follow the model of the Mombasa Tea Auction, which trades tea from more than 10 African countries. The NCE has been undergone changes over the years with the latest being a shift from manual operations to a digital platform. The digital platform will come in handy at the exchange should the trading go regional as traders from other countries will be able to follow the auction online without necessarily having to physically attend the auction. Mr Munya was speaking yesterday at the launch of a coffee revitalisation report, which looks at the progress that the sector has made since the reforms were introduced in the sector a year ago. Parliamentary Committee on Agriculture vice-chairperson Catherine Waruguru said the planned reforms in the coffee sector would boost the farmers’ earnings and revive the ailing sector. “As Parliament, we shall give all the support that is required to ensure the reforms are implemented for the benefit of the farmers,” she said. Ms Waruguru said the committee would fast-track the Coffee Bill to ensure it is passed before the country goes for elections in August 2022.
