Governor Wycliffe Oparanya said the implementation of the Kakamega County Health Facilities Improvement Fund Regulations, 2020 in the current financial year, which started on July 1, would impact positively on the delivery of services at Level 4 (sub-county) and Level 5 hospitals. He said under the new regulations the facilities are expected to manage own revenue collection and improve delivery of services without waiting for funds from the county's treasury. Hospitals management will also be allowed to hire staff on contract basis to address shortages. The county chief, however, noted that the hospitals would still get budget support. "From this month, public hospitals will enjoy autonomy they have been yearning for. All the revenue generated by the facilities will be ploughed back to the facilities,” said Mr Oparanya. Mr Oparanya said a special fund has been set up to support health facilities in the region. He warned officials to ensure prudent financial management of the resources and guards against corruption. The special fund will be managed by an advisory committee chaired by the County Finance chief officer. "The County General Hospital generates more than Sh100 million every financial year and if the funds can be channeled back to the facility, that would enable the management to introduce specialised medical services,” said County Executive for Health Services Dr Collins Matemba.
