KPA workers at the port. FILE PHOTO | NMG The Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) board has appointed former diplomat John Mwangemi as the acting managing director. Mr Mwangemi, who has served as Kenya's ambassador to Rwanda and Djibouti, replaces acting MD Rashid Salim who has retired. KPA has been without a substantive head for more than a year after Daniel Manduku resigned in March 2020 in the wake of corruption charges. He was succeeded by Mr Salim, the agency’s general manager for engineering, in an acting capacity. The recruitment process has been suspended three times, blamed on political interference.
