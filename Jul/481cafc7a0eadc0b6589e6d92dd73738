Green Park Nairobi terminus, Nairobi. FILE PHOTO | NMG Business owners willing to set base at the sh250 million Green Park terminus in Nairobi have until Friday to send applications. This follows announcement by the Nairobi Metropolitan Services (NMS) of plans to lease space at the terminal for commercial purposes or complimentary public transport services. In the plan, 35 percent of the space will be reserved for women and youths, five percent for persons with disability and the rest to the general public. Areas of leasing include commercial office space, commercial retail spaces (shops), supermarket space, eateries and ablution cleaning and management services. Others are entertainment establishments, vehicle cleaning services, vehicles fuelling and servicing services, advertising spaces, financial services and terminal cleaning services. However, traders who were operating from the demolished Lunar Park and people or firms who had previously expressed interest in any of the above or other leasing space at the terminal, do not need to apply. “This notice therefore, invites the general public to submit expressions of interest to lease space at the Green Park Terminal for various commercial purposes or complimentary public transport services,” said NMS Director General Major General Mohamed Badi in a public notice yesterday. “Expressions of interest are to be enclosed in plain sealed envelopes and must reach the office of the deputy director general by July 16, 2021 from the date of this advertisement,” he added. Green Park bus terminal, formerly Lunar Park, will be the new terminal for public service vehicles that have been operating from the Nairobi Central Station. This means the new bus stage will be the drop-off and pick-up point for matatus plying the Ngong and Lang’ata routes once it becomes operational.
