The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) has moved to court seeking to recover more than Sh198.4 million from companies associated with former officials of the Kenya School of Law (KSL). In a petition filed before the anti-corruption division of the High Court, the EACC says the money was paid to the companies between 2014 and 2018 for goods not supplied, through a scheme devised to embezzle public funds. The defendants are Morris Kiwinda Mbondenyi (Deputy Director), Amos Kabue Mwangi (former Assistant Director, Finance and Administratin), Frank Jackson Were (former Finance Manager), Hudson Amwai and Nobert Gondi Achiro ( former accounts assistant). Court documents show that the money was disguised as payment for goods or services rendered to KSL, yet nothing was delivered. Some Sh54.4 million was allegedly paid to Ademwa Enterprises, a company associated with Mr Amwai, who was then an accountant at the institution. “Investigations revealed that the said payments were made through an irregular, illegal and fraudulent scheme by the defendants with the sole aim of embezzling public funds,” says the EACC petition.
