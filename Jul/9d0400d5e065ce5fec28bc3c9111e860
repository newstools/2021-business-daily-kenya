The ICT Committee said it had agreed to enhance fines from Sh5 million to Sh25 million for individuals who publish messages designed to cause terror using electronic means. Those found guilty will also face long jail terms after MPs enhanced penalties from 10 years to 25 years. The Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes Act 2018 currently prescribes that those found guilty will face a Sh5 million fine or 10 years in jail, or both. “As a committee, we felt that the current law is not sufficient enough to deter individuals from recruiting young people into terrorism through the Internet. We have resolved to enhance the penalties,” William Kisang, who chairs the ICT Committee, said. Garissa Township MP Aden Duale sponsored Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes (Amendment) Bill 2021. He wants the Act amended to penalise sharing of pornography, terrorism and religious extremism and cult-like activities on the Internet. “Internet service providers should be obligated to block websites and webpages that contain content that fall under the prohibited content categories to safeguard public morality,” he said.
