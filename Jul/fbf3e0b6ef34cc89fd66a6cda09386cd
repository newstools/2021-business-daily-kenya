Car insurance accounted for more than half of the 87,699 policies cancelled last year as vehicles sat idle following Covid-19 movement restrictions that also hit cash flow and seizure of loan defaulter’s properties. The Insurance Regulatory Authority (IRA) data shows that Kenyans cancelled 48,235 car policies that saw premiums on cars drop Sh2.3 billion. Motorists owning private cars had the highest number of cancellations of 36,572 policies while commercial segment was second with 11,663 policy cancellations. The Association of Kenyan Insurers (AKI) Executive Director, Tom Gichuhi said many motorists cancelled their covers due to the state-imposed restrictions on movement and some could not just meet their premium payments. “A lot of people went for outright cancellation because of the lockdown. Other just did not have money to pay for premiums because they had lost their jobs or had lost their cars which were being repossessed by financiers due to non-payment of loans used to buy them,” Mr Gichuhi said. Car insurance plummeted on travel restrictions after government imposed lockdown measures, instituted curfews and regional trade was disrupted on border closures. Employers also instituted work from home guidelines which saw a majority of private vehicle owners park cars and stay indoors. Mr Gichuhi said not all insurers cancelled their policies as others decided to suspend their premiums for the period they expected their cars would not be in use, a practice that was not yet widespread. “When you are not using your car you can write to your insurance company to suspend your cover and not recall your premiums. It happens a lot when people take their cars to the garage but because a lot of people do not know this the just cancelled,” Mr Gichuhi said.
