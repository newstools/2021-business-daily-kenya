The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) had last year summoned top Agriculture ministry officials led by Crops Development PS Hamadi Boga over irregular payment of Sh1.8 billion to firms that imported maize during the 2017 drought. The payments were part of the Sh3.6 billion pending bills that the ministry owed a maize merchant, trading as Commodity House, for its importation of maize in 2017 Prof Boga had been accused of approving payment of Sh1.8 billion to Commodity House without the approval of the SFR board. Prof Boga is the administrator of the SFR Fund. “It should be noted that the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission found out in their investigation that the pending bills were legible,” Prof Boga told the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) on Thursday. Former SFR board chairman Noah Wekesa had raised a storm after he wrote a protest letter to the PS and another one to the EACC seeking an investigation into the withdrawal. The SFR had maintained that the withdrawal of Sh1.8 billion from its CBK account and payment to Commodity House without the board’s approval was against the law. “This is to officially report to your office that Sh1.8 billion has been unlawfully withdrawn from SFR account at the CBK at the closure of 2018/19 contrary to sections 4(3), 5(1)(c), 14(1) and (2) of the Public Finance Management (Strategic Food Reserve Trust Fund) Regulations 2015. Auditor-General Nancy Gathungu had flagged the Sh1.8 billion that was paid to Commodity House as of June 2019 on account of pending bills. She said the payment was made without the authorisation of the SFR oversight board as required under regulation 14 of fund’s regulations 2015.
