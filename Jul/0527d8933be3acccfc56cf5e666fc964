The fast food outlet that will be serving grilled chicken and fries will bring the total number of outlets under Kukito to 32. The group currently operates two Kukito eateries in Nairobi. The first was opened in 2019 is situated on Kimathi Street within the central business district, directly opposite KFC while the second one is in Gigiri. Besides Kukito, Java House Group currently runs Java restaurants, Planet Yogurt (PY) and 360 Degrees Pizza. The opening of more Kukito eateries is set to step up competition with fast food chains such as KFC and Subway which also serves deep fried chicken. “The new Kukito outlets will be opened in the next five years in various parts of Nairobi,” Java House Africa Group Chief Executive Derrick Van Houten told the Business Daily in an interview. “Kukito has been positioned in such a specific space in the market. Its grilled chicken and chips selling at between Sh300-Sh400.” The new outlets, Mr Houten said will create employment opportunities to about 200 workers. He remained non-committal as to how much the group will spend in setting up the 30 branches. “Opening up the new Kukito outlets will cost us millions of shillings,” he said. Java, bought in 2017 by private equity firm Abraaj, plans to grow outlet numbers in Kenya and expand in East Africa and beyond. Besides Kenya, it has operations in Uganda and Rwanda and at one point they had an ambitions to open outlets in Dar es Salaam, Lagos, Accra and Lusaka.
