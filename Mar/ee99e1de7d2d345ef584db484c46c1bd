Dock Workers Union Secretary-General Simon Sang. FILE PHOTO | NMG As elections for Dock Workers Union leadership draws near, embattled secretary general Simon Sang says he is looking to retain the seat. Mr Sang has told off his opponents who are calling for his retirement from the union insisting that he will contest and retain his position. DWU officials will today hold the last National Elections Council meeting which will decide on the date for election. The elections are supposed to be held before Mr Sang’s term expires in April. Some of the 12 aspirants who want to unseat Mr Sang claim that the elections won't be free and fair accusing their secretary general of interference. The aspirants include Edward Opiyo, Abubakar Mohammed, Said Chande, Alex Ndege, Robinson Thoya, Peter Opiyo, Harrison Lusigi, Alphaeus Aluoch and Harry Arigi. Mr Sang however says he will not interfere in any way. “I have no hidden agenda, the NEC meeting will decide date of election. We will have our NEC meeting today which will decide the date which will be given a notice of two weeks to have a special conference. We shall now start full campaigns and there will be no much activities in DWU,” he said. “But the leadership changes after registering newly elected leaders, there is no vacuum which is created as per the constitution.” Mr Sang said he has democratised DWU constitution, changed the terms of service of 3,219 employees in 2011 from casual to contracts and permanent and pensionable which he termed as a major milestone.
