Kenya Power workers repair a power supply line. FILE PHOTO | NMG The government must make efforts to pay Kenya Power Sh16.5 billion that the company is claiming for connecting more homes in rural areas to the national grid. It is shocking that the government has been wilfully defaulting for years in a partnership which it authored. The unpaid sums are part of the reason the electricity distributor is in a financial crisis, threatening the country’s economy and the welfare of consumers. Kenya Power has delivered its part of the deal and the Treasury must pay the dues that have been outstanding for years. If the government is unbale to pay the company, it should be honest and scrap the scheme. It cannot simply watch Kenya Power struggle and expect it to continue connecting more rural homes. Indeed, the company has said it is now focusing only on critical rural electrification projects as it seeks to reduce its exposure to government default. It is worth remembering that if Kenya Power were to go down, it is the same government that would be forced to bail it out as the majority and strategic shareholder.
