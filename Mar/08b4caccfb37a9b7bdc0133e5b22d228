FILE PHOTO | NMG East African Community (EAC) member-states need to address concerns over the quality of products exported within the region to avoid trade standoffs as witnessed this week. Kenya on Wednesday lifted a short-lived ban on imports of Ugandan and Tanzanian maize that had threatened to reopen trade tensions among the neighbouring countries. The Kenyan Agriculture and Food Authority had flagged high levels of cancer-causing aflatoxin found in some consignments. The ban was lifted on condition that all maize import dealers be registered and consignments coming in be accompanied with a certificate of conformity on aflatoxin. But the better solution lies in countries fast tracking the ratification of EAC-SGS standards on aflatoxin and submit the instruments of certification to the EAC. This will protect businesses from future losses as witnessed this week and consumers from purchasing sub-standard products. EAC countries should also learn to address trade issues without resorting to tariffs and bans. Such measures go against the spirit of building a strong economic union.
