FILE PHOTO | NMG City Hall defied the Covid-19 disruptions on businesses to record a Sh1 billion increase in its own source revenues for the six months to December. Controller of Budget’s latest data shows that the county raised Sh4.1 billion in the period under review, a 32 per cent increase from Sh3.1 billion collected a year earlier. The increase comes at a time businesses were interrupted with some remaining closed even as the country eased measures including travel bans into and outside the city and dusk-to dawn curfew that were imposed to curb spread of the Coronavirus disease. Internal revenue collections for the period under review are the fourth highest that City Hall has raised in six months to December since start of devolution and come at a time the county tapped Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) as its revenue collector. KRA took over as the revenue collector for City Hall in March last year after the county transferred four key functions to the State. The increase in internal revenues raises hopes that KRA’s appointment has plugged loopholes including corruption and use of outdated systems to collect levies and taxes that City Hall had blamed for its perennial own source revenue misses. The taxman is-in-charge of all the 137 revenue streams for the county government with Nairobi residents using mobile money to pay for services. Nairobi targets to raise Sh16.46 billion in the year to June from the revenue streams that include parking fees, rates and single business permits. City Hall has since the start of devolution struggled to meet its internal revenue targets.
