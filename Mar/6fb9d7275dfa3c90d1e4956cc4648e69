Water and Irrigation Cabinet Secretary Sicily Kariuki on Monday directed the contractor, Joycott General, to complete the works without delays. The Kanyuambora irrigation project, which is funded by the national government under the National Irrigation Authority, is expected to be completed in one and a half years. “This project will be closely monitored to ensure it is constructed to the required standards and completed on time,” Ms Kariuki said at the launch. It is expected to benefit at least 1,250 residents, who experience frequent drought due to unreliable rainfall. Once complete, farmers would be able to grow maize, pawpaws, cowpeas, onions, tomatoes, among others for food and for income generation. Embu Senator Njeru Ndwiga welcomed the project and urged for further development in order to benefit at least 6,000 locals. “As local political leaders we shall not drag politics into this project,” he assured the CS. Ms Kariuki said more residents would benefit in the second phase of the project. According to tender documents, the contractor is expected to construct an intake weir, a sedimentation basin, an infield system, among others on 625 acres.
