 A judge has declined a request by quarry operator Karsan Ramji & Sons Ltd and its subsidiary firm Ndovu Cement Ltd to set aside orders that suspended excavation of rocks from a mine in Kyuso, Machakos County. Justice Oscar Angoate said the orders dated January 19, 2021 will remain in force until April 27, 2021 when an environment-related dispute filed by Kyuso village residents will be mentioned. The temporary orders also stopped the two companies, their assigns, employees, agents, proxies or any other person working under their instructions from engaging in any acts of excavation or digging out hard rocks through blasting in quarries situated on various land parcels in Twimuna area, Kyuso. It also restrained driving of any prime movers or trucks on the parcels of land or in any way ferrying or transporting hard rocks or limestone or any type of soil. In urging court to set aside or vary the injunction orders, the companies argued that the orders are prejudicial to them since this is their sole business. The court heard that the injunction orders will affect the business and expose the companies to cases by third parties who had already placed orders for the limestone which the companies excavate from the premises. Further, that the companies’ businesses have not been proved to be unlawful or to cause any prejudice to the residents of Twimuma area in Gai sub-location Kyuso sub-county. They added that the orders were given on the basis that schools had just opened and yet the excavation started in 2019 and that the same orders had been declined by the court when the Plaintiffs’ case was filed at the first instance. The court also heard that the orders were issued in the absence of their advocates. The court heard that the advocates’ absence was not intentional and was occasioned by the fact that they were not able to log in to the court session in time due to technical challenges.
