Industrialisation and Trade secretary Betty Maina said Nairobi would engage London with a view to facilitating seamless dealings in key services which include financial transactions as well as investment flows. The two countries on Monday exchanged instruments of the UK-Kenya Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA), which was earlier in the month approved by respective parliaments, marking the official ratification of the pact. “The agreement we have signed is for trade in goods, but we look forward, as we indicated at the beginning of the negotiations, to also engage in other framework for trade in services, promotion of investments, and deepening economic and trade cooperation with United Kingdom,” Ms Maina said yesterday in Nairobi. Kenya’s successful push will see free flow of services such as financial transactions, investments and data, mirroring similar post-Brexit deals signed with developed countries such as Japan.
