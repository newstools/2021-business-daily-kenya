FILE PHOTO | NMG A judge and his wife have suffered a setback after the Court of Appeal stopped a Sh43 million compensation awarded to them for unlawful eviction from a prime plot in Kakamega town. Justice Munyao Sila and his wife Linda Chepkorir Ruto were awarded the damages on September 25, 2019 by Justice Nelly Matheka who found that their half-acre land had been forcibly taken by Kakamega county government without a compensation. However, the Court of Appeal has suspended execution of the judgement pending the hearing and determination of an appeal lodged by the county government. A three-judge bench comprising justices Gatembu Kairu, Agnes Murgor and Jamila Mohammed said Governor Wycliffe Oparanya’s administration has an arguable appeal against the judgment. The dispute revolved around a plot registered as Kakamega Municipality/Block III/7 which is adjacent to Bukhungu Stadium. Justice Munyao and his wife claimed to be the registered proprietors of the suit property after purchasing it in 2011. They argued that the property was prone to encroachment and applied for planning permission to erect a fence around it which was granted by the county government. Subsequently, they erected a perimeter wall. In 2018 the government forcefully entered thet property and began construction works entailing a wall to annex it to be part of Bukhungu Stadium, and laying of concrete paving blocks (cabro) to create a parking area.
