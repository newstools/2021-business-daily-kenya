PHOTO | SILA KIPLAGAT | NMG Kenya is making small but firm steps towards realising that its jobs glory and economic growth are tied to the success of small enterprises. Every year, the Economic Survey shows the small business keeps the engines of growth rolling and roaring. Therefore, the SMEs deserve more attention that has been seen. It is notable that Kenya now has dedicated SMEs agency. Apart from the Authority, it is noticeable that non-State organisations, including the private sector, the NGOs, and other development partners have increased the tempo of hosting SME arenas where business exhibit talent and goods. It is impressive. However, throughout these events, the running themes have been limited innovation, poor access to markets and not-so-firm government facilitation, taxation leading the agony list. We ask all the actors, including the government ministries, universities, and other private players like incubators to focus on these three top problem areas to deliver the SME glory faster than is envisaged. It will only make sense if the talks, the researches, and exhibitions lead to measurable action and goods.
