Ms Sarah Wairimu Kamotho accuses Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI), Inspector General of Police and Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) of violating her rights. A fortnight ago, a similar petition was dismissed by the constitutional and human rights division of the High Court. The widow wants the court to suspend her murder case, in which she is jointly charged with businessman Peter Karanja. She wants the court to compel the DCI, the police and DPP to take an inventory of items at her matrimonial home in Kitisuru Nairobi, which is being guarded by police as a crime scene. Through senior counsel Phillip Murgor, the widow says the inventory will avoid theft, vandalism, further wastage and destruction due to neglect and lack of maintenance while being guarded by police. She says the police should release the home for her exclusive control as the surviving spouse. In addition, she wants the police to hand over her Porsche Cayenne, KBW 171 G, which she says is her personal property. Also also seeks release of her two pet dogs named Major and Snow, which are being kept by animal welfare society in Karen.
