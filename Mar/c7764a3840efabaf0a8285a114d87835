The National Cereals and Produce Board, Nakuru depot. FILE PHOTO | NMG The National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) is seeking an additional Sh4 billion from the government to purchase maize from farmers after exhausting the Sh1.2 billion it for the exercise. This is after NCBP purchased 375,000 bags each weighing 90kg against the target of a million bags. The board is buying maize under its commercial wing for trading alongside other grains such as rice and beans. NCPB chairman Mutea Iringo said they had stopped taking in more supplies from farmers to avoid piling on more debt. “We exhausted what we had received from the government and we have now stopped buying from farmers because we do not want to owe them any money, as we have been paying in cash since we resumed purchases,” said Mr Iringo. NCPB had received Sh1.7 billion from the government as part of the debt that the State owed it for the services that the grain handler had undertaken on its behalf. The board is now requesting for the balance of Sh4 billion owed by the Treasury to continue with the maize purchase. The board had divided the Sh1.2 billion among different depots across the country, depending on expected volumes from different regions. A recent report from the Ministry of Agriculture showed that farmers are holding 18 million bags of maize as they anticipate the price will go up in future. NCPB has been buying maize at Sh2,700 for a 90kg bag and the move to stop the purchases pending availability of funds is likely to have an impact in the market price.
