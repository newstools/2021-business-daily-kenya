PPCK headquarters in Nakuru. FILE PHOTO | NMG Farmers are opposed to the recent appointments of the chairperson and board of directors of the State-owned Pyrethrum Processing Company of Kenya (PPCK). They argue that the George Wachira-led team lacks regional representation and is unlikely to implement a report on what ails the sector because five of the board members were part of authoring it. The report by the national steering committee on the revitalisation and revival of cotton and pyrethrum value chains is yet to be released since the group was only appointed in May last year. Broke PPCK has millions of shillings worth of equipment that has remained idle for 15 years and has even been declared technically insolvent by the Auditor-General, suggesting it needs financial support from government and its creditors. While dismissing the PPCK’s new board would be controversial, an arduous task awaits it. It should get the plant roaring back to life, engage the aggrieved farmers, who have had to go for up to four years without pay, and return Kenya’s pyrethrum to the world market.
