Taita Taveta Governor Granton Samboja. FILE PHOTO | NMG The High Court has struck out a petition filed by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) questioning authenticity of Taita Taveta governor Granton Samboja’s academic documents. In the petition, EACC wanted the court to declare that Mr Samboja was not eligible to vie for the governor’s seat because of his academic qualifications. It had claimed that the governor provided false information on the self-declaration form provided to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission. But Justice James Makau threw out the petition upon finding that his court has no authority to deal with the matter. He found that in filling the petition, the EACC was attempting to turn his court, which deals with Constitutional matters, into an election court. He described the failure of EACC to institute the dispute at the election court as a fundamental mistake noting that the petition stemmed from the election of Mr Samboja as a governor. “It is against the provisions of the law to turn election dispute to a constitution petition. EACC had other avenues. This court has no jurisdiction to hear and entertain the petition,” ruled justice Makau while allowing an objection filed by Mr Samboja.
