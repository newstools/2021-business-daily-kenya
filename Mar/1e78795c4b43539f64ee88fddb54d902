FILE PHOTO | NMG Grain millers have raised concerns about high levels of cancer-causing aflatoxin in maize being delivered to their premises for processing, coming at a time when Kenya has flagged imports from Uganda and Tanzania. The Cereal Millers Association (CMA) said in a statement yesterday that tests done by its members when receiving the grain have found that the aflatoxin levels are higher than the allowable 10 parts per billion. The millers have also raised concerns that the rejected maize is finding its way into the market through other channels. “As such the CMA continues to request the government agencies to encourage best practices for farmers, increase the use of Aflasafe to promote safe maize, increase testing at our cross border trade points, look at alternative uses of contaminated maize as well as have an elaborate mechanism of following up on the destination of rejected maize,” said the association in its statement. “Such efforts among others would ensure that contaminated maize does not end up in the market through other routes.” The disclosure by the millers comes just two weeks after the government banned maize imports from Uganda and Tanzania over high aflatoxin levels. However, following an outcry from the two countries, the government last week lifted the ban, but imposed strict inspection and origin tracing conditions meant to lock out contaminated grain. The Ministry of Agriculture said last week that all stakeholders dealing in maize imports would be required to be registered, the consignments must be accompanied by a certificate of conformity on aflatoxin levels and that traders have to issue details of their warehouses. The ministry also urged regional countries to fast track ratification of EAC-SGS standards on aflatoxin.
