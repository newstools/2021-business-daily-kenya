Former Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (Epra) boss Pavel Oimeke. FILE PHOTO | NMG The fight against corruption has not been easy in Kenya. Every time that the country seems to make some step towards making corrupt officials accountable for their actions, it take more steps backward. Lack of political will has been cited as a major reason for the stalling anti-graft war. That the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) has picked the former Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (Epra) boss, Pavel Oimeke, as its flagbearer in the upcoming Bonchari parliamentary by-election is a new low for a political party that publicly professes commitment to good governance. Granted, Mr Oimeke hasn’t been charged with any offences related to the recent incident where Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission detectives arrested him for allegedly soliciting a bribe while he was in office. But ODM has in the past campaigned on the lofty platform of change, including promoting integrity in public service. The opposition party will find it hard to stand on the high pedestal of anti-corruption fight that it has always aspired to. The bottom line is that people who have graft cases pending in court or under investigation should not be allowed to run for elective positions. In the event that they win, they may use those positions to tamper with evidence or intimidate investigation or prosecution officials.
