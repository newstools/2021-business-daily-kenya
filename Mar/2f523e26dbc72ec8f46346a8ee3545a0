The efficacy and impact of the entire SGR can only be seen and felt through cargo transport.

Kenya Railways Corporation (KRC) said Monday that 23,040 Twenty-foot Equivalent Units (TEUs) of cargo was carried on the SGR in February 2021, up from 17,974 TEUs moved in February 2020. Last month’s performance translates into an average of 8.2 trains carrying over 800 TEUs per day (230 trains), against some 210 freight carrying trains that were reported to have made the trip in February, 2020. Double-stack rail is a form of freight transport where railroad vehicles carry two layers of inter-modal containers. “The volume of goods transported on SGR went up in the last one year mainly due to the introduction of double decker loading which has pushed average daily supply up to 400 wagons,” said KRC managing director Philip Mainga in a statement Monday. On conventional cargo, SGR operator Africa Star Railway Operation Company delivered 128,291 metric tonnes of bulk wheat to Nairobi in February, 2021, against 3,897 metric tonnes delivered during the comparable period last year.
