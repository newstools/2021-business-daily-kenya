KFC, which operates locally through franchisee Kuku Foods East Africa, opened its first branch at Mombasa Trade Centre on Sunday, stepping up competition for customers with rival Java that has a presence in the area. The new branch will serve walk-in customers as well those working in nearby offices. “We have opened a new outlet in Mombasa and it’s the first branch by KFC in the county. It resumed operations on Sunday afternoon,” said Jacques Theunissen, KFC’s chief executive for East Africa in an interview with Business Daily yesterday. The new branch, coming barely a few months after Mr Theunissen took over the corner office from Mr Derrick Van Houten who left for Java occupies 220 square metres. The branch will seat a maximum of 50 people. The KFC did not disclose the cost of their investment or the source of revenues for the expansion. The outlet is coming at a time Kenya has seen increased interest from global fast-food outlets such as sandwich chain Subway and ice cream seller Cold Stone Creamery. Rising disposable household incomes, fast economic growth and a young population are attracting global players to emerging markets, according to a study by McKinsey & Co. Nairobi also hosts multiple multinational organisations, attracting the global restaurant operators. Apart from walk-in patrons, KFC is also reaping revenues from its delivery services. The company made 30,000 food deliveries in Kenya in November 2018 alone, contributing to 60 per cent of the total deliveries in the East African region. KFC started operations in Kenya in 2011. In East Africa, It has shops in Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda. The total number of outlets operated by the fast food chain in East Africa are 35. However, there are over 24,000 KFC outlets in more than 145 countries and territories around the world.
