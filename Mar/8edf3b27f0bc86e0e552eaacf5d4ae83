PHOTO | FILE | NATION MEDIA GROUP Former chief executive officer of the Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Corporation (REREC) Ng’ang’a Munyu is among four current and former State officers arrested on Thursday morning over a Sh86.84 million illegal deal to supply solar systems to public primary schools. The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) arrested Mr Munyu, James Muriithi (head of Renewable Energy), Joel Omusembe (head of Procurement), and Simon Kirui (an economist), who it said will be arraigned on Friday. The REREC, formerly Rural Electrification Authority (REA), officials are accused of awarding contracts to the two firms to supply solar systems despite the companies not bidding for the deal. North Pride Limited was awarded a Sh46.95 million contract while Nav World won a Sh39.89 million deal to supply the solar systems under the project aimed at providing electricity to primary schools. The EACC also ordered four directors from the two companies involved in the flawed procurement to present themselves at the commission’s office at Integrity Centre on Thursday afternoon. The four are Abdirahman Dakane Abdullahi, Hassan Sheikh Mohammed Diriye, and Fatuma Abdi Hassan, directors at North Pride, and Abdi Majid Abass of Nav World. EACC said that the eight will be charged with abuse of office, fraudulent acquisition of public property and breach of the public procurement law.
