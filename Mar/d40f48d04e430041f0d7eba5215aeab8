Rental houses in Nairobii. FILE PHOTO | NMG The proposal to scrap the Sh2,500 maximum amount of rent dispute between landlords and tenants that can be heard by the Rent Restriction Tribunal will help protect more tenants. Scrapping the limit as proposed in the Landlord and Tenant Bill of 2021 should be supported since the current cap is outdated and has left many tenants and landlords with little room for recourse when disputes arise. Data by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) shows the figure is less than the current Sh3,677.68 average rent paid for a single room in Kenya. Parliament should therefore expedite the repeal of the old law and ensure tenants and landlords transition to a legal regime that reflects economic realities. The existing Act has been in force since 1959 and gives the rent tribunal powers to hear and determine cases that include making orders for the recovery of possession of premises from the tenant and order for recovery of arrears of rent and service charges. But the rise in rent prices over time without addressing the cap has tied the hands of the tribunal that is also supposed to compel landlords to repair a house and refund money wrongly paid as rent.
