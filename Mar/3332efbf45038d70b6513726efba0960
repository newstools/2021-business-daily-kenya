President Uhuru Kenyatta. FILE PHOTO | NMG The High Court on Wednesday suspended an executive order issued by President Uhuru Kenyatta on March 12 directing the Tea Board of Kenya to conduct elections in all Kenya Tea Development Agency (KTDA) tea factories within 60 days. Justice Anthony Mrima put on hold the elections of the 54 tea factories, saying some parts of the order, touched on issues raised in another matter filed by Attorney General Kihara Kariuki, which sought to stop KTDA from holding elections in August last year. The judge said the orders issued by the High Court in Mombasa are still in force. KTDA filed the case last week, arguing that Mr Kenyatta has no powers to order for the polls. Through lawyer Benson Millimo, KTDA says the decision was made without affording the company a hearing. “The President has no iota of justification in law and or fact in seeking to interfere with the Petitioner’s lawful business, affairs and internal management,” Mr Millimo submitted. He said the national government has absolutely no power in law and fact to sanction and preside over the elections of directors of KTDA, its subsidiaries and shareholders. Further, he said a government-sponsored election of directors would result into the companies, including KTDA having two parallel sets of directors, as there are already existing directors in office. Justice Mrima directed the AG to file response to KTDA’s applications within 14 days. The case will be heard on April 20.
