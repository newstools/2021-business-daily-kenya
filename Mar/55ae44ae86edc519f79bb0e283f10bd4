The Labour court has reversed decision of the National Police Service Commission to sack a senior officer for failing to account for his wealth and huge M-Pesa transactions. While ordering for reinstatement of chief inspector George Mburugu Ikiara, the court said the Commission failed to consider the officer’s evidence that he was a businessman, hence the huge and frequent transactions were justifiable. Justice James Rika questioned why the employer was bothered by the transactions of less than Sh2 million considering that he had invested in residential blocks and was involved in maize and sale of clothes with fellow officers and friends.
