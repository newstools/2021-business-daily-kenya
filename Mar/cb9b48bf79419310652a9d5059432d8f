The draft National Cooperatives Development Policy proposes to bring all financial cooperatives into the regulatory umbrella of the Sacco Societies Regulatory Authority (Sasra). The new policy will also beef up of the role of Commissioner for Cooperative Development, whose ability to provide effective regulation has been hampered by inadequate workforce. Passing this policy will help tame the financial improprieties that have characterised non-deposit taking savings and credit cooperative societies (saccos) that are currently not under Sasra oversight. Absence of a robust regulatory framework has only served to open an avenue for officials to embezzle and run down saccos while escaping prosecution. The proposed policy will also allow for smooth transition of regulation of saccos as they expand their services from back office to front office operation. Only strong oversight can reverse the trend of rising number of saccos reeling under the weight of mismanagement, fraud and bad loans.
