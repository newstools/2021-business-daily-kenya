Bungoma governor Wycliffe Wangamati. FILE PHOTO | NMG The Director of Public Prosecutions(DPP) has declined a recommendation by the anti-graft agency to charge some officials of Bungoma county government over the irregular purchase of land for construction of official governor's residence at an inflated price of Sh163.2 million. Instead, the DPP returned the file to the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) with instruction for further investigations. EACC wanted the DPP to prefer criminal charges against the county chief officer in charge of lands, urban and physical planning, the interim head of supply chain management and members of the county tender committee. The agency had recommended that the officials be charged with the offence of willful failure to comply with the law relating to procurement. EACC received a complaint alleging that the governor Wycliffe Wangamati-led government spent Sh153 million to purchase a 32-acre piece of land for the Governor's residence at an inflated cost and that there were glaring irregularities in the procurement process. The tender was awarded to New Nyanza Wholesalers at Sh163.2 million without engaging a government valuer, EACC claimed. Elsewhere in Turkana county, the DPP has accepted EACC's recommendation to commence a criminal trial of seven government officials and directors of a trading company for irregular award of tender for supply of a fire engine. EACC in its report says the fire engine was never delivered after part payment of Sh20 million was made to the supplier Winston International Company Limited. Investigations established that the fire engine was purchased without the requisite budgetary allocation in the financial year 2014/2015.
