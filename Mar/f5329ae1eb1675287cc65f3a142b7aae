The Insurance Regulatory Authority (IRA) said driving after curfew hours does not warrant motor vehicle insurance policyholders any exclusion from their existing policies. This comes after a notice by the insurers’ lobby warned vehicle owners – personal cars, commercial and public service vehicles – that they would not receive any settlement for accidents during curfew hours. “As per the authorised and standardised motor insurance policy documents, driving past and during curfew hours is not an exclusion in the current motor vehicle insurance covers,” IRA said. “As such, insurance companies cannot reject motor vehicles claims on the basis of timing.” Following Friday’s government directives expanding curfew hours to start at 8pm from the previous 10pm to 4am to contain the surge in coronavirus infections, the insurers warned that driving during curfew hours could render motor insurance claims invalid. But IRA said it has not received any request by insurers to change the terms of the policy standards. “Insurance companies are not charged with enforcing the Covid-19 containment measures. For those found contravening the set directives, relevant law enforcement agencies will take necessary action,” IRA warned the insurers.
