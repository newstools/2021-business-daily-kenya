The authority said on Friday the system will also boost the capacity of Kenya’s biggest airport to handle more planes and cut flight delays. “We are buying a new Air Traffic Management system (ATM) because the current system is coming to end of life,” KCAA director-general Gilbert Kibe told the Business Daily. Mr Kibe said the authority also plans to cover other airports with the upgraded system. “Enhanced safety comes from modern surveillance equipment for example radar systems that allow closer spacing of aircraft approaching airports so that we can accommodate more traffic in our airspace at the same time without risk,” he said. The system will be fitted by Spanish information technology company Indra. In 2015, Indra was engaged in a legal battle with a Chinese rival over the supply and installation of the surveillance equipment for the KCAA.
