Tractors deliver cane at a sugar factory in western Kenya. FILE PHOTO | NMG Sugarcane farmers in Central region now want the government to treat them equally with growers in Western and Nyanza regions. They say the industry is worth Sh3.5 billion in the region, an amount that can increase to more than Sh20 billion if they add value by making molasses, wines and juices. “This can only happen if we are involved in input subsidies, credit and value addition. If the industrialisation goal of the Big Four agenda is to factor us in as sugarcane growers, we will not disappoint,” said the Central Cane Farmers Association Secretary General David Mwangi. Mr Mwangi, who owns cane plantation in Kirinyaga County, told Business Daily at his farm that between 2017 and 2020 there were 8,850 registered association members from Murang’a, Kirinyaga, Embu, Nyeri, Kiambu and Nyandarua counties. He said the sector employs at least 10, 000 people are involved in brokering, wholesale and retail cane in area market centres. “We are worth Sh3.5 billion in combined market return and the creditworthiness that our occupation qualifies us to access. We are not structured since we are yet to be recognised as a full-fledged sector in Central Kenya,” Mr Mwangi said. He said if supported, many farmers can grow cane in large farms as opposed to the current situation where most of them practice small scale production. Muhoroni, Homabay, Chemelil, Miwani and Sony, Mumias, Nzoia, Tana River and Busia are categorised as the country’s cane basket. Mr Mwangi said they have discovered that technologically modified varieties take four months to mature unlike traditional cane that goes for two years before harvesting. “This is a sector that if given the necessary support can absorb many of our unemployed youths and serve as an ideal instrument to battle grassroot poverty since cost of production is barely two percent of returns,” he said.
