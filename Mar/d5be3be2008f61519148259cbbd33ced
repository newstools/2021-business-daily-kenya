The US says it will put the proposed trade deal struck with Kenya by the former Donald Trump regime under “review”. The US Senate last week confirmed Katherine Tai, a former trade lawyer for the Obama administration and Congress, as the trade representative. Ms Tai said during her confirmation hearing before the US Senate said that the Biden government will review the proposed deal before further talks. “If confirmed, I plan to review the state of the negotiations with Kenya, and, in consultation with Congress, chart a path forward that reflects the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to a trade policy that prioritises the interest of America’s working families,” she told the Senate when asked about the timelines for talks on the Kenya deal. Kenyan officials have however remained bullish on the future of the deal. “As soon as that confirmation (Ms Tai’s) is formally announced by Congress, we will be ready as we have always been in getting business done,” Mr Johnson Weru, the Trade Principal Secretary told Business Daily earlier this month. A change of guard at the White House raised uncertainty over the FTA deal, with Mr Biden embarking on the reversal of many policies that had been rolled out by his predecessor.
