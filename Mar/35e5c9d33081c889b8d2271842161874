The National Cereals and Produce Board, Nakuru depot. FILE PHOTO | NMG The National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) says it will stop the purchase of maize from farmers once it exhausts Sh1.128 billion that was allocated by the government. Joseph Kimote, the managing director, said NCPB has so far spent Sh860.5 million leaving a balance of Sh267.5 million. He told the Senate committee on Agriculture that as at March 4, the board had purchased 573,914 bags each weighing 50 kilogrammes at Sh860,511,780. Mr Kimote said the total cash disbursements for the maize purchases is Sh1.128 billion. “Upon exhaustion of these funds, NCPB will not be in position to continue purchasing more maize due to the financial limitations enumerated above,” he said in submissions to the committee. The board opened its stores for purchases in January when market prices were as low as Sh1,800 per 90 kilogramme bag at farm gate. Mr Kimote said NCPB entry price was set at Sh2,500 in compliance with the directive issued on October 14, 2020 by the government. “Later the price was reviewed upwards to Sh2,700 per 90kg bag to align to the market forces and has remained the same to-date,” he told the committee chaired by Embu Senator Njeru Ndwiga. The NCPB increased the prices mid-January, setting the stage for competition for maize in the market. The board reviewed the prices after it failed to get more supplies from farmers, three weeks after it opened its depots for purchase of grain. At the time of review, it had only bought slightly more than 2,000 bags as farmers shunned the board to sell their maize to traders and millers who were offering slightly higher than what the NCPB is paying. Millers were at the time of review paying up to Sh2,600 for a 90-kilogramme bag of maize, making it difficult for the cereals board to attract stocks from farmers. The board is buying maize under its commercial wing for trading alongside other grains such as rice and beans.
