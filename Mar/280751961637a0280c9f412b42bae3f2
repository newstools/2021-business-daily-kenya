The directors said they are opposed to the elections scheduled to take place on April 10 in all the three factories in the region. Speaking at Kathangariri Tea Factory, the directors said the government has no moral authority to call the polls to elect factory leaders. "Only the KTDA which is mandated to call elections and therefore we shall not participate in the ones ordered by the government," one of the directors, Samuel Mwafrika said. The directors from Rukuriri, Mungania and Kathangariri tea factories called on the more than 28,000 farmers to remain steadfast and keep away from the polls. "Farmers should refuse to be missed by self-seeking individuals. They should also not participate in the polls," added Mr Mwafrika. The directors reiterated that they are legitimately in office and swore to always defend the farmers from attempts to run down their factories. They added that they were not opposed to the reforms being carried out in the tea sector but the government should stop meddling in the affairs of KTDA. The directors complained that they were not even consulted when the government came up with the new rules to govern the sector. They told the government to leave KTDA alone to deliver services to the farmers without interference as it is a private entity. Another director, Joshua Kanake said the move by the government was tantamount to breaking the law that it swore protect. " How can the government order for the polls without express permission from KTDA?" another director Eston Mugo said. "The farmers should not bow to intimidation by the government. They should not go to the polls even if they are forced." The directors alleged a plot by the government to use force to have the polls conducted.
