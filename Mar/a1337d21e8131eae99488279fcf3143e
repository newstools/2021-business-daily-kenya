The facelift project will entail refurbishment of offices, repainting and re-roofing, creation of two modern receptions as well as rehabilitation of washrooms at the facility. The repainting of the old City Hall and repair of offices, the county government said, is aimed at providing and maintaining quality physical infrastructure for improved work environment and customer care. City Hall, especially City Hall Annex, has been synonymous with failing lifts forcing those seeking services at the various offices in the building to use the staircases, which are always dark due to frequent power blackouts, to go as high as thirteenth floor. According to the County Annual Development Plan (CADP) for the financial year ending June 30, 2022, Sh60 million will go towards refurbishment of different offices in City Hall. This is aimed at creating adequate office space for improved work environment at the county government. A total of Sh40 million will be used in re-roofing of City Hall while another Sh15 million will go towards repainting for improved work environment. Another Sh10 million will go towards the refurbishment of washrooms in various offices at the county government.
