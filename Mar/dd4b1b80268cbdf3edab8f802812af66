 The draft regulations by the Communications Authority of Kenya (CA) seeking higher quality standards for mobile phone imports into the country are good for consumers. The regulations published Wednesday provide for a three-year jail term or a Sh300,000 fine or both for anyone found importing or selling a mobile phone with a battery life of less than eight talk-hours. Mobile phones have become a necessity for most Kenyans. Consequently, it is critical to only allow in devices that are of good standards and can serve users well. Unscrupulous traders have exploited loopholes in the law to import substandard phones, which pose a health hazard and shortchange consumers. Cases of defective batteries exploding while charging have been reported in the past, causing bodily harm to users. It will also ensure that Kenya does not become a dumping ground for used electronics from developed economies. With advancement in battery technology, eight talk-hours is the least that the agency can ask for. This marks the latest attempt by the regulator to address quality issues in the fast-growing telephony market. The last major crackdown on sub-standard mobile phone products was in 2012. We expect to see action taken against individuals and enterprises that will not adhere to the new standards.
