A memorandum on formation of a central liquidity fund that will see Saving and Credit Cooperative Societies (Saccos) start lending from each other will be presented to the Cabinet this week. Commissioner of Cooperatives Geoffrey Nja’ngombe said 52 deposit taking Saccos have already shown interest in joining the fund. “We have a guideline on bringing Saccos together and we already have polices in place in regard to this and they will be going to Cabinet next week for approval,” said Mr Nja’ngombe. He  added thatthe body will be registered as a cooperative as well, in what will form one of the largest Sacco organisation in Kenya with over Sh100 billion in combined assets. The fund will start with deposit taking saccos and offer front office services, while other regulated saccos will be brought on board as second-tier members. Agriculture and Cooperative Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya confirmed that the policy will be forwarded to the Cabinet this week. “The policy will be put before Cabinet this week and thereafter it will be forwarded to the Parliament for legislation,” said Mr Munya. The commissioner said cooperative movements need to amalgamate their resources in order to be more competitive in the financial sector. Cooperative Alliance of Kenya chief executive Daniel Marube said the central liquidity facility and a shared ICT platform will strengthen saccos and save those undergoing difficulties. Mr Marube added that they are conducting reforms in the sacco sector to compete well with the banks. “The saccos in financial sector are in direct competition with the banks and a lot has changed and we want to come up with reforms that will put saccos in a fair platform to compete with these banks,” he said. He said the introduction of central liquidity is one of the ways of placing the saccos on a good platform to compete with the banks.
