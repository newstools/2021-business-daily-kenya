FILE PHOTO | NMG A group of nine teachers’ unions from across the world have asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to intervene and end wrangles between the Teachers Service Commission(TSC) and the Kenya National Union of Teachers (Knut). The unions are concerned that the long-standing dispute is crippling Knut, reducing its membership and eroding its revenues. Currently, Knut membership stands at 17,000 from the 187,471 in 2019, according to data from the TSC. “Knut members have also suffered discrimination on promotions and salary upgrades through TSC changes made without consultation and legislative approval,” read Education International African Region, one of the unions in its letter to President Kenyatta. The unions wrote separate letters on diverse dates between March 19 and March 23 addressing Mr Kenyatta. They include the Syndicat National des Enseignegnements de Second degre’ (Paris), the National Education Union (UK), All India Primary Teachers Federation (AIPTF) and New Zealand post Primary Teachers Association. Others are South African Democratic Teachers Union (SADTU), Syndicat Des Enseignant.Es Romand.Es, National education union(London) and the Formation EY Enseignement Prive’s. In the latest dispute, the Knut secretary- general Wilson Sossion has accused the TSC of tempering with the union’s register. Parliament in August last year asked the Knut and the TSC to consider withdrawing legal suits against each other to end their long-standing dispute
