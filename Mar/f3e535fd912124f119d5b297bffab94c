The integrated Customs Management System (iCMS) which is 90 percent complete is expected to be rolled out fully in June. "With full implementation of iCMS, we expect Kenya's ranking at the World trade index to go up by 20 position. In the system, we have integrated 41 modules and we expect the remaining four to be completed by June this year," said Dr Desai. iCMS will enable revenue authorities to receive declarations of goods before ships dock at the port, reducing the time taken to clear goods. Kenyan has implemented a number of programmes in the past decade which has seen the time to import and to export goods fall in the EAC by 54 percent and 92 percent. For the same period, the turnaround truck time between Mombasa and Kampala has fallen from 18 days to four days while costs to import and export have fallen, in the same period, have redcued by 45 percent and 66 percent respectively, according to TMEA report released this year. With these achievements, Covid-19 has tried to push back the efforts forcing a number of stakeholders to come together to prevent further decline. Some of the programmes the Kenyan government and other regional governments have implemented which has boosted efficiency and revenue collection include Single Customs territory (SCT) which involves goods being cleared by lodging a single declaration in the country of destination and the goods being subsequently released upon confirmation by the country of destination that the taxes have been paid, unlike in the past when multiple declarations at the borders were made.
