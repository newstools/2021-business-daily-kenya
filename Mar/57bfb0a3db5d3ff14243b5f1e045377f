The pioneer class Wednesday took an oath from industry regulator, Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentist Council, as an approval that they are qualified. They young doctors will be expected to undergo through a mandatory 13 months internship programme. This comes as the government struggles to resolve the problem of inadequate healthcare provision that many medical professionals say has been left to fester by successive administrations. Dr Eva Njenga, chairperson of the council urged the doctors to put the interests of the patients first while she administered the oath. MKU was granted approval to offer Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of surgery in May 2014. It would later partner with Thika Level 5 Hospital and other health providers for practical training Kenya’s doctor-to-patient ratio is one to 16,000, according to official data, far below a recommendation of the UN World Health Organisation of one to 1,000.
