The cash crunch, worsened by the Covid-19 pandemic as loan defaults spiked owing to layoffs and a hiring freeze, has forced the agency to explore new financing models. The agency this week told Parliament that it was seeking Sh10.98 billion syndicated loan from an undisclosed US multinational. But the best solution still lies in Helb getting innovative in loan recovery to reduce defaults that have weakened its ability to provide loans, scholarships and bursaries to new and continuing students. Matured loans stand at Sh45 billion, giving it a non-performing ratio of 23 percent—higher than the banking average of 14.1 percent. Failure to address the loopholes will see it stuck in a vicious cycle of borrowing to pay off its debt obligations. Students will continue to pay an interest of four percent even as it taps the foreign credit at a higher interest of seven percent. If Helb doesn’t get aggressive in sourcing and recovering funds, even the vision to convert to an education bank will remain a pipe dream.
