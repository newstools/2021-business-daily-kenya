FILE PHOTO | NMG A non-public officer is in charge of taps that controls the pipeline of Kenya’s public resources — the Integrated Financial Management Information Systems (IFMIS), a new report shows. The report by the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) accuses the Treasury of breaching the Public Service Human Resource Policy by taping a consultant, Stanley Kamanguya, into the role of Acting Director – IFMIS. “The appointment of Stanley Kamanguya, a non-public officer who was also a practising consultant into the sensitive role of Acting Director, IFMIS was in total disregard of the Human Resources Policy in the Ministry,” PAC chaired by Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi said. PAC said the Treasury did not engage the Public Service Commission to fill the position of the Director of IFMIS as prescribed in the law and regulations. “Contrary to the provisions of human resource policy, the National Treasury has designated a non-public officer into the role of acting director — Integrated Financial Management Information Systems,” the report states. Parliament now wants the PSC to revoke the appointment of Mr Kamanguya within three months of tabling and adoption of its report.
