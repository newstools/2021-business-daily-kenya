FILE PHOTO | NMG The resignation by the director-general of the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (Epra) Pavel Oimeke is a welcome move that should have been made earlier. Resignations should become more common among public servants implicated in corruption and other ethical breaches. Mr Oimeke was arrested by detectives from the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission in December last year for allegedly demanding a Sh200,000 bribe from an employee of an Oyugis-based fuel station. Like any other accused person, he has a right to defend himself in court and should be afforded due legal process. The practice of public officers continuing to hold office for months or years while court cases drag on has reinforced the perception of impunity. In other jurisdictions, government officials routinely resign for even non-criminal issues, sometimes stepping aside to take responsibility for an organisation’s collective failure to discharge its duties. Kenya’s public servants must aspire to higher personal standards for themselves and the organisations they lead.
