Parliament buildings in Nairobi. FILE PHOTO | NMG The Bill that imposes hefty fines on chemists that dispense prescription drugs illegally is long overdue. The proposed law sponsored by Nandi MP Alfred Keter will see individuals trading in medicine without a registered health practitioner’s written prescription face three years in jail or a fine of up to Sh30,000 for the offence. As the MP reiterated, self-prescription and over-the-counter sale of medicines is a public health hazard that endangers the safety and lives of Kenyans. Abuse of drugs is also prevalent in fuelling crimes like lacing of drinks and food, especially in bars and public transport. In unfortunate cases, the victims have lost their lives due to overdose. Self-prescription of some medicines such as antibiotics has resulted in drug resistance, which compromises the effective treatment of diseases. The Pharmacy and Poisons Board crackdown on the proliferation of unregistered or unlicensed chemists is also key to getting rid of quacks in the lucrative business. The law will not only complement the existing regulations but also ensure that Kenyans benefit from the services of qualified health practitioners, boosting safety and easing the disease burden.
