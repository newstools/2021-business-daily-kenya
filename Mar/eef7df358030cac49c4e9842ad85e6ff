The digital testers will replace the cylindrical glass vessels currently dipped in milk to test impurities and that are prone to erroneous results. Dairy farmers have over the years grappled with milk rejection by processors due to quality and safety concerns leading to losses. “The State department of Livestock intends to purchase milk analysers to be used for testing samples delivered before mixing with the rest in the collection tanks,” read a notice published in Ministry of Agriculture website. The department is seeking to engage suppliers of milk analysers for onward distribution to cooperative societies in 40 counties. The digital machines will help detect high bacteria load, added water and other impurities which affect quality of produce. The equipment should also be able to test and display digitally protein, fat and sugar levels and out a receipt indicating unit rate, amount payable and other reports. Kenya Dairy Board maintains use of preservatives in milk is prohibited, saying the product should only be preserved through cooling.
