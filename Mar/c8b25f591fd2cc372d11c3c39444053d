Kepsa said Thursday that the nationwide curfew that starts at 10pm should commence from 9pm to 4am for the next three weeks, after which it can be reviewed to assess impact. The push to ease the night curfew, hich was imposed in April last year, comes as monthly infection increased to 18,734 in March from 5,200 cases in February , which informed the extension of the night curfew in March to May 12. Deaths have also increased to 213 cases in March up from 93 in February while the positivity rate — positive tests against total tests — have increased from 4.6 percent in February to 16.5 percent in March. President Uhuru Kenyatta on March 12 extended the 10pm to 4am curfew by two months and the ban on political rallies by 30 days in the wake of a spike in Covid-19 infections in the country.
