Insurance Regulatory Authority CEO Godfrey Kiptum. FILE PHOTO | NMG The Insurance Regulatory Authority (IRA) has begun processing payouts by tapping into the Policyholders Compensation Fund set up 16 years ago for the first time to settle claims of failed insurers. For policyholders and beneficiaries, some of whom have been left in misery for decades, this offers a much welcome relief. The collapse of several insurance companies over the years exposed policyholders to risks and losses of benefits, denting confidence and hindering the sector’s growth. The establishment of the fund was to cushion holders of insurance policies in the event that companies are unable to discharge their services. But despite its existence, nobody has ever been paid as compensation is pegged on dissolution of the companies. There is therefore need to speed up court processes to ensure that claimants get their dues in time. Already, there are estimated 12,470 claimants for Sh4.39 billion. IRA said it would begin with claims of Concord Insurance which collapsed eight years. After the long wait, IRA should guarantee quick compensation so as inspire confidence.
