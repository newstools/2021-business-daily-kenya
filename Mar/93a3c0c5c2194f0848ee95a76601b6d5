Mathira MP Rigathi Gachagua. FILE PHOTO | NMG Mathira MP Rigathi Gachagua has defended his ownership of a Sh1.5 billion property near Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA), which a retired civil servant says was grabbed from him. Mr Gachagua says he legally owns the property situated off Mombasa Road, having purchased it from a couple for Sh24 million in June 2012. Through his lawyer Philip Nyachoti, Mr Gachagua also says Mr John Michael Ohas, who claims the land, has never appealed against a decision of the National Land Commission, which found Mr Gachagua’s title genuine. Mr Nyachoti also says the attempt by the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) to interrogate the matter is illegal and unconstitutional because it does not have powers to determine decisions of NLC. “Further, I believe that the investigations... are tailored towards achieving some other ulterior motives and purposes other than the sanctification of the criminal justice system as required by law,” Mr Gachagua says in an affidavit. Mr Ohas, a former director of physical planning in the Ministry of Lands, moved to court saying the title registered in the name of Wamunyoro Investment Ltd, a company linked to the MP was obtained fraudulently. Documents filed in court show that Mr Ohas was allocated the plot in 1994 by former President Daniel Moi. He said he was allocated the land through his company Columbus Two Thousand Ltd and paid Sh50,000 after accepting the offer in May 1996. But Gachagua says the land was allotted to Karandi Farm ltd, owned by Mr Peter Nduati and Ms Pauline Muringe and who paid Sh54,000. The case will be heard on June 7.
