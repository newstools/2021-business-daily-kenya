FILE PHOTO | NATION MEDIA GROUP When the Agriculture ministry started dishing out the Sh3 billion cherry advance to farmers last year, it was expected that the money would benefit the small scale farmers and help him buy crucial farm inputs. However, the farmer now rues the day they filled the forms to access the fund that is calculated at Sh20 a kilo for produce delivered to factories. Most growers have not benefited from the money since they have huge debts with their societies. With most delivering an average of 500kgs of cherry per season, the most they can access is Sh10,000, which they say is too little to make any impact in their lives. Since growers apply for the fund through their societies where they are highly indebted, the deductions leave them with no money. Mr Samson Kimathi, a farmer at Nkubu, Imenti South said last season, his 400kgs secured him Sh8,000 advance. “The money was so little that I could not buy fertilisers, pay casuals and take care of my other needs. The government should look for another method of disbursing this advance as we seek ways of increasing production,” he said. Conversely, estate farmers who produce up to 100,000kgs of cherry are laughing all the way to the bank. Mr Charles Mutwiri, an estate farmer in Imenti Central said he would soon apply for Sh1 million advance based on his 50,000kgs. “The money is helping us buy farm inputs and pay for labour costs. The problem with some farmers is that they don’t take care of their bushes to increase production,” Mr Mutwiri said.
