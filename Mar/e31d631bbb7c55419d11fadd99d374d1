The new Ankole Grill and Bar in Nairobi’s Kitisuru is the kind of place you go on a date night. Because it says “this is me trying.” And there is nothing wrong with trying. The theme is matte black. The design is modern, boxy and engaging. The bar stares at you when you walk in and you may sit there or you may sit in the garden or further inside, which didn’t look too exciting. And if they are full— as they were — they will put a high table and stools in a patch of grass with a view. The staff are friendly and helpful. Music comes from somewhere. Maybe underground. It’s subtle. A mirage of sound. The crowd is uppity and very eclectic but most certainly everybody I saw had a forward fashion sense except for the guy I was with who had on a striped loud polo shirt. And myself, of course. Let’s call him Thuo because that’s his first name. He knew everybody; a hot shot lawyer, a guy in weird pants that look like a hare-trap who is a notable fashion designer, a well-known lady from a political family, two chaps in the young and hip table with a bottle of vodka who are sons of a media mogul, an attractive lady in a devastating dress who owns a marketing firm, a gay guy with a well-tended facial hair who is a choreographer... On and on it went, him pointing at folks with his chin and me going, ‘what? I don’t know anyone in this town.’ Get wine by the bottle. They have a variety. Whisky by the tot will kill you if you aren’t from a wealthy family, or is a choreographer or tend your facial hair well. They also have a happy hour, from 4pm or 5pm. The place also has a cigar lounge, meeting rooms, events and conferencing facility. The food is amazing and you should try their steak because well, they are known for great steaks. Like I said, it’s a place that says, “I’m trying.”
