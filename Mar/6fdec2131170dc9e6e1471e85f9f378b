FILE PHOTO | NMG Sugarcane farmers will from tomorrow earn more for their sweat after the Sugar Cane Pricing Committee increased the price of the raw material by eight per cent. From April 1, millers will be required to pay growers Sh4,040 per tonne of sugarcane from the current Sh3,700 that has been prevailing since 2018, coming as a boost to growers. Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya Tuesday said millers will have to adhere to the new price failure to which they will face a Sh500,000 fine or one year imprisonment. “Having considered that the prevailing sugar ex-factory prices over the past three months was Sh4,659, the committee approved an increase in the price of cane from the current Sh3,700 per tonne to Sh4,040 effective April 1, 2021 in line with the industry cane pricing formula,” said Mr Munya in Nairobi at a press conference. “Any farmer being paid less should report to the authority,” he said. The CS said the Sugar cane Pricing Committee uses a simplified formula to ensure that farmers benefit directly from improved sugar prices in the market.
