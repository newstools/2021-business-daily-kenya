 The court ruling declaring the acting Director of Surveys Polly Wanjiku Gitimu as unfit to hold public office over past links to fraudulent land transfer is laudable. Employment Court judge Nelson Abuodha found that questions over Ms Gitimu’s integrity are an impediment to her being recommended for promotion or appointment to another public office unless the dispute is resolved in her favour. The ruling should set a precedent for resolving cases where individuals whose actions raise leadership and integrity questions continue to holding public office. The practice of public officials holding onto their jobs despite being implicated in graft has entrenched the notion that it is futile trying to slay the dragon of impunity. And this, even as the tools necessary to win the fight, are available. Chapter Six of the Constitution is dedicated to leadership and integrity and there are law enforcement agencies such as the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission and the Judiciary to help win this war. Citizen Juma Okumu challenged Ms Gitimu’s appointment, citing Chapter Six of the Constitution. The judge agreed with him.
