Nairobi City skyline. FILE PHOTO | NMG Property owners in Nairobi have been put on notice for land rate defaults, with the authorities saying that they will seize the assets temporarily to recover the outstanding amounts estimated at more than Sh15 billion. This enforcement action was inevitable, seeing that 90 percent of owners of office blocks and residential units have defaulted on the levies despite various offers, including waivers of penalties. It is the duty of every citizen, business and organisation to pay taxes owed and there should be no expectation that payment of land rates is optional. Besides, property owners expect the county government to provide them with an array of services to support their business or for the enjoyment of their residence. These include construction and maintenance of public infrastructure such as roads, water and sanitation. All these cost billions of shillings and need to be paid for through taxes and revenue allocation from the central government. Property owners can only demand improved services when they have paid what is due from them. City Hall, working with the Kenya Revenue Authority, must now make good on their threat to seize defaulters’ property. This will motivate them to clear their balances and regain control of their assets.
