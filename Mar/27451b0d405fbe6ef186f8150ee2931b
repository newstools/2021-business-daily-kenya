Justice Maureen Odero directed the ministry to pay the companies a combined sum of Sh58,967,500 plus interest at court rates from January 2019 when they filed the case until payment in full. The judge found a valid contract existed between the parties for the provision of space for advertising in the magazines and publications owned by Mr Savula’s firms. The companies are listed as Johnnewton Communication Ltd, The Sunday Publishers Ltd, The Express Media Ltd, Cross Continents Venture Ltd, Shieldlock Ltd and Melsav Company ltd. However, in their claim in court the companies wanted a total of Sh129.7 million. Mr Savula told court that in breach of their respective contracts and terms of agreement, the ministry had failed or refused to pay the companies their respective advertising charges. In his evidence, Mr Savula relied on media booking contracts executed between the companies and the ministry as well as a Contract Agreement dated April 15, 2013 executed between the Johnnewton Communication Ltd and the Ministry of Public Works. The MP stated that despite demand having been made, the ministry failed to pay the amounts due to them. Hence the court case. But Justice Odero, while declining to grant the claim of Sh129.7 million, found that Mr Savula had been paid Sh108.2 million by the ministry. The MP on his part insisted that the payment was for other contracts and had no bearing on the claim in court. The judge said the MP failed to avail documentation to prove which invoices had been paid and which ones remained unpaid.
