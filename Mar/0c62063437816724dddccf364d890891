University of Nairobi main entrance. FILE PHOTO | NMG Employment court has ordered the reinstatement of Prof Michael Madara Ogot as the Deputy Vice Chancellor at the University of Nairobi. Justice Maureen Onyango said the sacking of Prof Ogot in October last year was without basis because the contents of a circular he has issued, cancelling the installation of Prof Stephen Kiama, as the Vice Chancellor, were factual. Prof Ogot was accused of insubordination after he issued the circular cancelling the installation. This was after Education secretary George Magoha revoked the appointment of Prof Kiama and appointed Prof Isaac Mbeche in acting capacity. “It is my finding that the claimant acted on authority of his immediate supervisor and the University Board to issue the impugned internal memo dated 18th January 2020,” Justice Onyango said. The judge added that the contents of the said circular were factual and that all accusations against Prof Ogot were levelled against the wrong person. The court heard that Prof Ogot was appointed to the position in July 2019 on a five-year contract. He moved to court terming the termination of his employment as was unfair The installation of Prof Kiama, had been scheduled for January 21, 2020 but was later cancelled. He defended himself saying that the board decided that all members of staff, stakeholders and students should be informed that the installation would not proceed.
