Tractors deliver cane at a sugar factory in western Kenya. FILE PHOTO | NMG Many sugarcane farmers will no doubt feel upbeat about news that the Ministry of Agriculture has raised the minimum earnings per tonne of the commodity delivered to millers. In latest price review, the millers will now have to pay farmers at least Sh4,040 for a tonne of cane, up from the Sh3,700 that has been prevailing since 2018. The government must now follow up to ensure that factory managers implement the price changes without fail and punish those who defy the directive according to the law. The industry cane pricing formula was put in place to help farmers fetch prices that can help them recover their input costs and allow them a profit. Implementing the price changes is the only way farmers can benefit directly from the ministry’s directive and lift their fortunes and that of the local sugar industry. The ministry should also follow up to ensure farmers receive the actual payments on time. Many millers have overstayed with farmers’ money, prompting some of them to borrow to finance their daily needs while putting the sustainability of their farming business at risk.
