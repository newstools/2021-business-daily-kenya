National Lands Commission (NLC) acting chief executive officer Kabale Tache Arero Tuesday confirmed to the Business Daily that the commission has paid over 80 per cent of the 987 affected persons. The State had set aside Sh4.2 billion for the project compensation. “Eldoret bypass compensation is almost concluded, only a few cases remaining,” she said. She said cited ongoing court cases for most of those yet to be compensated with the parties lacking the proper property ownership document. The project was launched by President Uhuru Kenyatta on 1, August 2017 and was expected to be ready by August last year, but the pay out tussle affected the schedule. Kenya National Highways Authority, which is overseeing the project had set April as the new completion date, but a spot check established that some interchanges like Cheplaskei are yet to be completed. The State is aimed at reducing the traffic snarl up in Eldoret.
