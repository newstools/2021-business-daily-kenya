A former sales executive at Amref Flying Doctors has sued the air ambulance services provider demanding compensation for allegedly using his image without his consent. Gideon Nyaga, who worked at Amref for two years says the company never sought his consent to use his image for advertisement purposes even though he was an employee. Mr Nyaga says the image, which was taken after he and other employees were asked to go for a photoshoot, has been used by Amref on social media for marketing purposes against his right to privacy. He says the constitution gives every person the right to privacy, yet he was photographed without his consent and the photo was later used for commercial purposes.
