Data from the Controller of Budget (CoB) shows that each of the 2,243 MCAs took home Sh78,424 on average a month for attending assembly meetings, down from Sh87,562 earned in the corresponding period a year earlier. The drop came at a time county assemblies scaled down on sessions and committee sessions as part of the measures imposed to curb spread of coronavirus. The Covid-19 restrictions cut the amount that MCAs in the 47 counties earned as sitting allowances in the six months to December to Sh1.06 billion from Sh1.16 earned in similar period a year earlier. The Sh78,424 that each MCA took home per month on average in the six months to December is the lowest in the period since start of devolution. Ward representatives from Kajiado County earned the lowest at Sh5,071 per month followed by those in Bungoma at Sh10,946. Isiolo MCAs took home Sh17,239 per month and their colleagues in Wajir Sh25,146. In the period under review, four counties breached the limit on MCA’s allowances that is set at Sh124,000 per month. “The County Assemblies of Homa Bay, Nyamira, Kisumu and Elgeyo Marakwet reported higher expenditure on sitting allowances than the recommended monthly ceiling of Sh124,800 by the Salaries and Remuneration Commission (SRC),” Controller of Budget Margaret Nyakango says in the report. MCAs in Nyamira County led the gravy train after they took home Sh140,973, followed by their Kisumu counterparts who earned Sh139,688. Ward representatives in Elgeyo Marakwet came third at Sh125,010 and their colleagues in Busia, Sh124,270. The SRC had in 2018 reduced the cap on MCA’s sitting allowance to Sh80,000 from Sh124,000 per month, but the High Court High quashed the move forcing the SRC to return to the previous cap. MCAs' sitting allowances have since been on an upward trajectory, raising concern that the perks were consuming county government revenues with minimal corresponding impact on public service.
