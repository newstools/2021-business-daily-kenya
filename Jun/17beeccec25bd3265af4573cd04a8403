The tribunal said the KRA made an error in levying excise duty from the lender. KRA and lender agreed to drop some of the claims but differed on the treatment of appraisal fees prompting KCB to file a case at the tribunal rejecting KRA’s assessment. According to KCB, all income earned from issuing a loan should be treated as interest from a tax perspective and only subjected to income tax. The tax tribunal said in similar cases involving Co-operative Bank , Barclays Bank , and Stanbic Bank  it has ruled that appraisal fees, loan commitment, and processing fees fall within the definition of interest which is specifically excluded from “other fees”. “KRA erred in law in failing to appreciate that appraisal fee is part of the interest and thus exempt from the Customs and Excise Act and the Excise Duty Act,” KCB argued in the case. KCB said a return on loan is excluded from the definition of “other fees” in Part III of the First Schedule to the Excise Duty Act. Therefore, appraisal fees, loan commitment, and processing fees are proceeds received by the bank as a result of disbursing a loan are excluded from other fees. “Having found that appraisal fees are “interest” and not “other fees”, the Tribunal finds that's the Respondent has no basis for levying excise duty,” the tribunal said. KCB charges up to 2.5 percent appraisal fees on some loans, negotiation fees, ledger fees as well as legal and valuation fees.
