The Capital Markets Authority (CMA) has once again extended the deadline for coffee dealers to acquire trading certificates even as it issued the first set of five licences. The CMA had given coffee traders up to July 1 to comply with the new regulations but has now pushed the deadline by a further three months, saying this will give traders who have not complied more time to do so. “In order to ensure that there is no disruption in the coffee value chain, the authority has granted an extension of three months to the marketing agents currently trading at NCE for them to apply for the coffee broker licence,” said CMA chief executive Wyckliffe Shamiah. The new move implies that some traders at Nairobi Coffee Exchange may be operating under two systems as the brokers who have been licensed are now tied to the new laws while the old regulations are still operational. For instance, the new regulations require brokers to send farmers money to Direct Settlement System, a departure from the current one where the funds are sent to marketers before paying it out to growers. The regulator has issued Meru County Coffee Marketing Agency Limited full licence while Kipkelion Brokerage Company Limited, Murang’a County Coffee Dealers Company, Mt Elgon Coffee Marketing Agency Limited and United Eastern Kenya Coffee Marketing Company Limited have been granted conditional licences. This is the second time that CMA is extending the deadline. The new laws were supposed to be effective in July 2020 but were pushed back by a year. The new development comes when the sector is witnessing a supremacy battle between CMA, which by law is supposed to be the regulator of spot commodities and the Ministry of Agriculture that has dismissed the agency’s role in the regulation of coffee. The Capital Markets (Coffee Exchange) Regulations 2020, which were gazetted in April, gave the authority the mandate to license the coffee exchange and brokers.
