PHOTO | WACHIRA MWANGI | NMG Domestic tourists cut their holiday expenditures by 37.5 percent last year, a new industry report shows, coming on the back of massive job losses and pay cuts as companies reduced operating costs amid liquidity challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic. Data from the Tourism Research Institute (TRI) shows that the average expenditure on package trips fell from Sh44,043 in the pre-Covid period to Sh27,545 during the pandemic. Spending on recreational activities fell the most at 22 percent followed by food and drinks (13 percent), transport (10 percent) and accommodation (five percent). This was a big blow to hotels, which hoped to ride on domestic tourism to cover the loss of income due to the restrictions and bans in international travel during the pandemic.
