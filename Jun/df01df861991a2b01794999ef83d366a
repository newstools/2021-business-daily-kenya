Twiga said that vendors will also get access to business support via loans and insurance, more products as well as earn cash back when they shop online, through the e-wallet. “For many of our vendors, Soko Yetu has become essential in running their businesses. We continue to look at ways of improving their experience and ensure we are giving them what they need to grow their business,” said Twiga’s East Africa chief executive officer Yebeltal Getachew. “In the near future vendors will be able to generate additional revenue from the sale and purchase of airtime, power tokens and other value add businesses to allow them to grow their business.” Twiga uses technology to aggregate demand and streamline logistics in distribution of farm produce such as bananas, onions, tomatoes, potatoes, mangoes and cabbages, to small-scale vegetable vendors in city estates, thus helping make products more affordable and increasing sales for vendors. It serves about 33,000 vendors every month with an average of seven orders per week per vendor, and also operates in Uasin Gishu, Embu, Meru, Kirinyaga, Machakos, Nakuru and Kiambu counties. The upgrade of its platform comes barely a month after it diversified into rice distribution to meet rising demand, adding the Soko Yetu rice brand to its portfolio. The firm also plans to expand to the West African region as it seeks to grow its market share on the continent. Since its founding in 2014, the company has raised billions of shillings including equity and loan deals from international investors such as the International Finance Corporation.
