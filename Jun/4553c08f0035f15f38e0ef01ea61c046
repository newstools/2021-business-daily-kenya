The CS, his principal secretary Andrew Kamau, and Daniel Kiptoo, the acting director-general Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (Epra) were scheduled to appear before the Energy Committee of the Senate on Wednesday to answer a question raised by Vihiga Senator George Khaniri on the sharply rising fuel prices. The three officials did not turn up on claims that the session coincided with another meeting of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (Comesa) that they were attending. Mr Kiptoo instead sent Edward Kunyua, the director of petroleum and gas at Epra to represent him at the meeting but the committee refused to take evidence from him. “You (Mr Kunyua) can’t answer questions on behalf of the CS and the acting director-general. The law only allows Cabinet Secretaries and their Principal Secretaries to address us. This Cabinet Secretary is not taking this committee seriously and we will not take it lightly,” Ephraim Maina, who chairs the committee said on Wednesday. The committee has now issued a fresh summon for Mr Munyes to appear before it in person on June 14, 2021, to respond to Mr Khaniri's question. “We will impose a fine of Sh500,000 if he fails to honour the summons or ask the Inspector-General of Police to arrest him and present the CS to this committee,” said Mr Maina. The Parliamentary Powers and Privileges Act, 2017 allows committees of Parliament to impose fines not exceeding Sh500,000 on individuals who fail to honour invitations or produce documents before House teams. “I invoke section 18 and 19 of the Parliamentary Powers and Privileges Act, 2017 to require the Cabinet Secretary to appear before us on June 14 without fail,” Mr Maina said.
