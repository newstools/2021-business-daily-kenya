The first CMA CGM vessel to make a maiden call will dock in Lamu on July 4 from the former Soviet Union where it is expected to collect about 50 twenty-foot equivalent units from Zanzibar to Far West. Kenya Ports Authority’s Geoffery Namadoa said the vessel would be the third to dock at the port after MV CAP Carmel and MV Seago Bremerhaven, which made their maiden call during the opening of Berth 1 on May 20 by President Uhuru Kenyatta. "On Sunday we received two harbour mobile cranes, which mark the last batch of key equipment for cargo handling now we can handle any vessel at the moment. Early July, we expect to receive one of the largest ships from CMA, which is currently at the [former] Soviet Union," he said. Mr Namadoa said Lamu Shipping Company would also bring its first vessel Amu 1 with cargo from Zanzibar in the next few days. He said apart from the firm, which is based in Lamu, Express Shipping Line has transported some of its cargo handling equipment to the port.
