Construction works at Kalundu dam in 2011. FILE PHOTO | NMG Kitui is seeking investors to develop and operate its artificial beach in plans to boost tourism potential in the county. Upon completion, the eco-park at Kalundu dam in Kitui town will include a snake park, animal orphanage, children play equipment, floating restaurant, swimming pools and space for eatery bandas. “The County Department of Tourism would like to engage private investors with the ability to establish and operate particular recreation facilities as per specific stipulated terms of reference,” says the county. The project sitting on 30.9 acres with a nine-acre dam is expected to help the county repackage its tourism. Governor Charity Ngilu said the tourism facility could include amenities such as kayaking and jet skiing. The development comes at a time Kenya’s tourism sector is thirsty for revival after suffering a setback due to the effects of Covid-19. The country imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew, banned social gatherings and suspended international and domestic flights to combat the spread of the coronavirus. The Tourism ministry announced that Kenya would lose up to Sh80 billion from tourism last year after an impressive performance in 2019 when the sector earned Sh163.6 billion, a 3.9 percent rise from Sh157.4 billion in 2018. The Treasury has marked tourism among its priority sectors to drive the revival of the economy.
