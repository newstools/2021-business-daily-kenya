The facilities managed by the Kenya Airports Authority (KAA) become the first airports in East and Central Africa to join the programme, achieving Level One “Mapping” accreditation. “Reducing the effects of our operations on the environment is an important goal for us. It is our responsibility to future generations to engage in efforts that counter climate change,” said KAA acting managing director Alex Gitari in a statement yesterday. “This accreditation is an important step in the right direction for our main airports, as the Airport Carbon Accreditation programme provides a framework to optimize and, eventually, minimize emissions.” The programme, owned by Airports Council International, is the only institutionally-endorsed, global carbon management programme for airports.

The initiative is in line with the authority’s 2018-2022 strategic plan which highlight’s environmental stewardship as one of its main strategic areas with a goal of obtaining ISO 14001-2015:
