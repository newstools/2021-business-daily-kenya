Also locked out are State officers other than the Principal Secretary for livestock or a county executive member representing the Council of Governors. “A person shall not be qualified for appointment as a member of the board of a livestock agency established under this Act if he is a State officer, is a member of a governing body of a political party or has been removed from public office for contravening the Constitution or any other law,” the Livestock Bill, 2021 states. The Bill seeks to establish the Livestock Inputs and Products Regulatory Authority, the Kenya Livestock Research Organisation, Livestock and Livestock Marketing Board, Kenya Veterinary Vaccines Institute, Kenya Tsetse, and Trypanosomiasis Eradication Council, the Kenya Animal Genetic Resource Centre, and Kenya Leather Development Authority. The proposed law further seeks to establish livestock training institutions and an academic board which will be independent of the training institutions. “The training institutions academic board shall exercise oversight over the examinations offered by the respective training institutions and provide quality assurance for the academic programmes offered by the training institutions,” the Bill states. The State-backed Bill sponsored by Majority Leader Amos Kimunya provides for the establishment of county livestock training centres by county governments. The proposed law provides for the designation of a county as a recording region for purposes of animal registration and identification.
