In a highly charged session, the Senate adopted a report by the Devolution and Intergovernmental Relations Committee, paving the way for Nakuru to become the fourth city in Kenya. The other cities are Nairobi, Kisumu and Mombasa. During the session, 38 senators voted in support of the elevation, whereas two rejected it. County Senator Susan Kihika, who had previously opposed the elevation, changed her stand and supported the move. Governor Lee Kinyanjui, who followed the Senate proceedings virtually, welcomed the move saying it was long overdue. “I am very happy. I always knew Nakuru was ripe to become a city. I laud the senators for granting Nakuru city status. This will unlock the region’s untapped economic fortunes,” he said.

The report will now be presented to President Uhuru Kenyatta to give Nakuru a city charter. Read more here
