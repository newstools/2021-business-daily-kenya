The State Department for Broadcasting told Parliament that it had written demand letters asking defaulting institutions to pay up. The Department told lawmakers that public universities top the list of institutions that consumed advertising services through GAA and failed to honour their commitment to pay, citing lack of funds. “We have written letters to public universities who form the bulk of non-compliant institutions. Universities have argued they do not have money to pay for the advertisement placed on media institutions on their behalf,” Esther Koimett, the Principal Secretary, said. She told the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) that GAA is committed to set up a collection mechanism coupled with timely reconciliations of the internally generated revenues. “Furthermore, GAA has put in place a recording system that clearly tracks the advertisements made and the status related to appropriations in aid (AIA) collections,” Ms Koimett said. Ms Koimett appeared before PAC to respond to audit queries raised by Auditor-General Nancy Gathungu. Ms Gathungu said the statements of appropriations reflect budgeted proceeds from the sale of assets of Sh1.17 billion against actual receipts of Sh667.9 million hence a shortfall of Sh506,097,430 or 43 percent.
