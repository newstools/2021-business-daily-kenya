UAE-based Montfort has acquired a majority stake in Kencor Petroleum Limited, a subsidiary of Galana Petroleum Investment Limited. The financial details of the transaction were not disclosed. The firm however said it has received the nod from Kenya's competition watchdog and other relevant regulators for the buyout. "Yes, all the necessary approvals for the acquisition of Galana K together with subsidiary Kencor Petroleum were obtained prior to completion of the transaction," the firm’s public relations representatives told Business Daily. The PR representatives said Montfort’s headquarters are in Geneva, Switzerland and the trading operation is in Dubai, UAE. The company said the acquisition of Kencor, an active participant in Kenyan Open Tender System (OTS) imports, is the first step to expanding its operations into the region and neighboring countries. "Montfort Group is a newly formed group of companies with a diverse portfolio of commodity related businesses, run by an efficient management with decades of experience in commodity trade," says Montfort on its website. No staff will be affected by the restructuring, the firm said adding its immediate focus, is regional expansion. "Our immediate objective is to focus on continuing growing the business acquired, the rebrand of it will be done when the time is right," its representatives said. "We are maintaining all the existing staff of the business and very much look forward to integrating them into Montfort Group." Editor’s note: A previous version of this story erroneously reported that Montfort has acquired Galana Oil which operates under the brand name Delta. Kencor, a subsidiary of Galana Petroleum Investment Limited, is a different company and is not related to Galana Oil Kenya Limited.
