MPs during a session at Parliament chambers. PHOTO | FILE The National Assembly has recalled MPs from recess to a special sitting tomorrow to consider the nomination of four persons to fill the vacant positions at the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC). The Justice and Legal Affairs Committee (JLAC) has cleared Juliana Whonge Cherera, Francis Mathenge Wanderi, Irene Cherop Masit and Justus Abonyo Nyang'aya for appointment as IEBC commissioners. The committee chaired by Kangema MP Muturi Kigano conducted approval hearings for all the four nominees on August 24. It is expected to table its report on the vetting of the nominees on Wednesday morning ahead of MPs debate and voting in the afternoon session. The four will replace former IEBC vice chairperson Consolata Maina, Margaret Mwachanya, Paul Kurgat and Roselyn Akombe who resigned from the commission. Ms Maina, Ms Mwachanya and Mr Kurgat announced their resignation in February 2018, citing lack of confidence in the management of IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati. Ms Akombe resigned and fled the country after the annulled results of the 2017 General-Election. President Uhuru Kenyatta appointed Ms Maina, Ms Mwachanya and Mr Kurgat to various ambassadorial positions. Ms Mwachanya was picked to be Kenya’s deputy head of mission to Islamabad, Pakistan. Ms Nkatha and Mr Kurgat were posted as deputy head of missions in Moscow, Russia and Rome, Italy respectively.
