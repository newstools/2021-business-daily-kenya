The Cereal Millers Association (CMA) said in a statement that Kebs should have instead reached out to the affected firms to verify and validate results for each batch before going public on the matter. “This would have been the most effective way of dealing with the matter, ensuring that it does not happen again and making sure proper recall procedures for specific batches rather than in its entirety, were followed to get the products off the shelf as effectively as possible,” said the millers association. “It is unfortunate that some of our millers who appeared in the press release have still not been informed why they were non-compliant.” The Kebs on Saturday banned 27 brands such as Family, Pembe, Equatorial Ugali Afya and Budget, among others, for failure to meet quality standards. It ordered a cessation of production and distribution for the affected brands, and a recall of those products already on shelves. Kebs has in the past raised issue with aflatoxin levels, as well as misleading information on the level of nutrient fortification in some flour brands. The millers, however said that implementing Keb’s lated directives will be expensive for them, both in terms of financial losses and damage to their brands in a competitive market. “It is unfortunate the lack of due procedure by Kebs has resulted in the loss of business to millers, lower consumer confidence and reputational damage to both millers and their brands,” said the association in the statement.
