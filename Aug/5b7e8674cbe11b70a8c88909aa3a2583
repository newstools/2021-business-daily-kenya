PHOTO | WILLIAM OERI Former chief executive officer of the Kenya National Examinations Council (Knec) Joseph Kivilu has been awarded Sh9.5 million following his suspension five years ago over claims of examination malpractices. Dr Kivilu had sought more than Sh24 million from the agency after the March 2016 suspension on claims of malpractices and leakages that rocked the 2015 Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) exams. The former CEO resigned in 2017 saying the year-long suspension was causing him mental anguish as well as subjecting him to professional and financial ruin. “I have further taken into account the anguish of the claimant in the award of maximum compensation to cater for the improprieties that bedeviled his disciplinary process,” Justice Maureen Onyango said as she awarded him Sh6.2 million. She also directed Knec to pay Dr Kivilu Sh1.75 million for accumulated leave days and a further Sh1.56 million in three months’ pay for not issuing him with a notice. Knec defended itself saying the investigations were being conducted by the police and thus the disciplinary process could not proceed pending the conclusion of the investigations.
