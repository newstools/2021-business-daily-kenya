The programme is funded by the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) through the US Agency for International Development (USAID). It targets to expedite access to a range of biomedical products that are affordable, acceptable, safe, and effective for HIV prevention. US-based non-governmental organisation, FHI 360, will lead a consortium of local and international partners in implementing the programme. Other partners in the consortium include Kenyan-based LVCT Health, Pangaea Zimbabwe AIDS Trust, Wits Reproductive Health and HIV Institute, based in South Africa. The USAID raised concern that HIV incidence among women across sub-Saharan Africa remains high. “Four in five new HIV infections in persons aged 15-19 years old occur in females,” USAID said. “By accelerating the introduction of new HIV prevention products, and expediting prevention product availability, acceptance, and uptake, this new award will ensure that women, especially among adolescent girls and young women, can live a life free from HIV.’’
