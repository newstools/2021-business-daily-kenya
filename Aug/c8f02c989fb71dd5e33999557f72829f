The Kenya Roads (Amendment) Bill, 2021 also proposes to cut the years of experience needed for one to qualify for an appointment as director-general from 15 to 10. “A person shall be qualified for appointment as a Director-General if a person has at least 10 years experience in a managerial position within the road sector,” the Bill states. The Kenya Roads Act 2007 requires a director-general to be a member of the Institution of Engineers of Kenya and have at least 15 years of post-registration experience in road and highway engineering. The present law also requires that the job holders be registered with the Engineers Registration Board under the highway engineering category. Transport Committee chairperson David Pkosing sponsored the Kenya Roads (Amendment) Bill 2021. “We are seeking to address the issue of succession management. Currently, the post of director-general is a club of a few engineers in the road and highway category. We are now opening it up to other civil engineers,” Mr Pkosing said. The Bill seeks to increase the term of office of the Kenya National Highways Authority, Kenya Urban Roads Authority and Kenya Rural Roads Authority director generals from three to five years.
