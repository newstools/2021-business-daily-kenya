FILE PHOTO | NMG The Kenya Copyright Board (Kecobo) has revoked operating licences for agencies that collect and distribute royalties on intellectual works by artistes for three months or until further advised. In a notice to the public, Kecobo said the Kenya Association of Music Producers (Kamp), the Performers Rights Society of Kenya (Prisk), and the Music Copyright Society of Kenya (MCSK) violated licensing conditions. The board says that out of Sh114 million in royalties collected as at the end of July 2021, the three collective management organisations (CMOs) distributed only Sh41 million, representing 35.9 percent, instead of 70 percent of the monies, which is about Sh79 million. “It should be noted that the distribution excludes money received and expensed in the other accounts out of Kecobo monitoring system,” said Kecobo Executive Director Edward Sigei.
