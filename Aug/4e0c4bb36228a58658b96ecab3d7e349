Taxpayers at KRA offices in Mombasa. FILE PHOTO | NMG Taxpayers can now apply for relief of penalties and interest under the voluntary tax disclosure programme (VTDP) on the iTax platform. This follows a recent enhancement of the iTax platform to allow online submission of VTDP applications. The VTDP is an olive branch extended to all taxpayers who for one reason or the other failed to disclose taxable income between July 1, 2015 and June 30, 2020. It was introduced through the Finance Act of 2020 and runs from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2023. Taxpayers who apply for relief under the programme will have penalties and interest on the principal taxes disclosed, waived. The extent to which the penalties and interest are waived under the programme depends on the point of application within the three-year period. Taxpayers who apply for relief in the year 2021 and pay the principal taxes fully will enjoy 100 percent waiver of penalties and interest. However, those who apply for relief and fully settle their principal taxes in the years 2022 and 2023, will only be entitled to a waiver of 50 percent and 25 percent, respectively. This means that the earlier one does the application and pays the principal taxes in full, the higher the percentage of the relief granted. Taxpayers who are yet to come forward are, therefore, encouraged to take advantage of the remaining months of the year to get full remission of penalties and interest. For the period between January to July 2021, more than 300 applicants had applied for relief under the VTDP. The total revenue implication from the applications received amounted to more than Sh2.7 billion, with a collection of around Sh999 million. Taxes that can be disclosed under the VTDP include individual income tax, Pay As You Earn, withholding taxes, capital gains tax, value added tax, turnover tax, advance tax, excise duty, rental income tax and corporation tax.
