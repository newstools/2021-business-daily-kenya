Sugar imports. FILE PHOTO | NMG Sugar dealers shall be required to present proof of shortage in the domestic market before importation if MPs approve changes to the law. Factories and importers will also be compelled to obtain pre-import approval from the State in new measures aimed at curbing flooding of the local market with cheap sugar. The National Assembly’s Agriculture committee has proposed further amendments to the Sugar Bill, 2019 sponsored by Kanduyi MP Wafula Wamunyinyi. “A person who imports sugar into Kenya shall, before importation, provide a sample of the sugar to be imported and pre-import verification certificate from the country of origin,” Mr Silas Tiren, who chairs the committee said. Those found in breach of the law will face a Sh10 million fine or five years in jail. Kenya imports sugar mainly from the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa(Comesa) to cover for production deficits locally. According to the Sugar Directorate, imports of the commodity between January and June this year stood at 237,581 tonnes compared to 200,442 tonnes in the same period last year. The higher imports came even as local production recorded a 22 percent increase, with growth in local yields attributed to improvement in sugarcane supply to private millers The Sugar Bill, 2019 also seeks to reinstate the Sugar Act which was repealed through the enactment of the Crops Act, 2013. If enacted, the government will restore the Kenya Sugar Board (KSB) whose mandate was taken over by the Sugar Directorate of Agriculture and Food Authority (AFA). The committee has recommended that the new Kenya Sugar Board be headquartered in Kisumu. The MPs want the Bill changed to spell out sugar catchment areas that will include the Upper region, Lower region, and Coastal region.
