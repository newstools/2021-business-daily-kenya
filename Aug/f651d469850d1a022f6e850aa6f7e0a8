The MPs said failure by the Treasury to release cash meant for the 290 constituencies had stalled planned projects. “The total allocation to CDF in this financial year is Sh41.714 billion but none has been released two months in the financial year. The projects and bursaries meant for the student have been sabotaged,” Wafula Wamunyinyi said. The NG-CDF Act, 2015 sets aside 2.5 percent of the total revenue raised nationally to be shared among the constituencies. Out of the CDF budget of Sh41.7 billion, each of the 290 constituencies has been allocated Sh137 million for development in the year to June 2020. Mr Wamunyinyi, who chairs the National Government Constituencies committee of the National Assembly (NGCDF) wants the Treasury to release part of funds before December to allow MPs finalise project. “I appeal to you that even as the Treasury prepares to release the allocations for the first quarter, prepare project proposal for the NGCDF to approve to fast tract planned projects,” the Kanduyi MP told lawmakers in a brief on the status of NGCDF disbursements. The Treasury allocated NGCDF Sh41.7 billion in the current financial year out of which Sh137,880,879 will go towards projects in each of the 290 constituencies. The committee has previously tussled with the Treasury following failure to release cash to the constituencies.
