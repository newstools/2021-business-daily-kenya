Central Bank of Kenya. FILE PHOTO | NMG The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) survey showing that a majority of banks plan to direct their liquidity to government paper at the expense of private sector is worrying. While government papers’ risk-free feature is attractive, banks should not forget that also have social obligations to support the economy. The preference for risk-free lending is a blow to private firms and households — many of who are seeking loans for recovery following revenue declines, business collapse, and loss of jobs in the Covid-19 environment. Banks should strike a balance between profitability and contribution to the economic good since a weak private sector risks more business failures and job losses. Snubbing the private sector will delay the recovery of businesses and weaken the ability of borrowers to repay the billions of shillings already owed to banks. The pace of private sector credit growth has remained below 10 percent and this may deal a blow to the government’s economic recovery efforts. The State should also cut its appetite for domestic borrowing so that banks can direct resources to the productive sectors.
