The practice of mindfulness can help you be a well-respected and effective leader. PHOTO | FOTOSEARCH It’s not the most popular word out there but you’ve definitely stumbled upon it at least once in your life. Mindfulness is so powerful that it has the ability to change your life and the way you perceive things or people. Don’t be mistaken. There is a fine line between ‘mind-fullness’ and ‘mindfulness’ and in this short article, I will uncover the differences then explain you the one benefit for you. The first one, which is also dangerous is being mind-full. An individual that is mind-full is not aware of his surroundings and in a matter of time becomes oblivious. When a person is mind-full he might find that people don’t give him the respect he expects to receive or some people may even avoid him and this is because when your mind-full your brain is passive to any information. You are not realising that you receive what you emit. Your brain is basically on auto-pilot mode and you have trained it to be in a denial of knowledge. An example would be listening to a lecture or speaking to someone. A professor may be giving a lecture but your brain is on auto-pilot mode, your mind is far away in thoughts. You may be speaking to someone but you’re simultaneously thinking about work, friends and home-related issues. The mind refuses to absorb information quickly and seamlessly as it used to previously do. However, when a person is mindful with one ‘L’ he is fully aware and observant of what he is doing. An individual who possesses this skill is admired because they tend to listen and understand better. The technique of being mindful is quite easy to implement and does not require any money or equipment. When you speak to the next person, try to be in the moment and live in the now. Be fully in that conversation and don’t let your mind wander off. If it does wander off then gently bring it back.
