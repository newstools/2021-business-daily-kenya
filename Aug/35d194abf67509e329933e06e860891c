The Makongeni MCA will know his fate on August 24, 2021 when judgment on the case will be pronounced. This is after Milimani Law Court Senior Resident Magistrate Carolyne Muthoni Njagi found Mr Imwatok with a case to answer after receiving testimonies from six witnesses presented by State prosecutor Winnie Moraa. Ms Moraa urged the court to place the MCA on his defence as there was ample evidence that he illegaly had in his possession a firearm. “Upon receiving all the defence submissions, I will make my pronouncement on August 24, 2021 in open court,” said Ms Njagi. The vocal MCA is facing four counts of illegal possession of a firearm and ammunitions and forging a firearms certificate. The MCA is said to have committed the offence on September 10, 2017 at the junction of Lusaka and Enterprise Road in Galitos Restaurant, Industrial Area,Nairobi, where he was unlawfully found in possession of a Ceska Pistol.

He was also given an alternative cash bail of Sh50,000.
