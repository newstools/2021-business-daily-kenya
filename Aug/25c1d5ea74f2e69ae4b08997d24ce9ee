FILE PHOTO | NMG The National Cereals and Produce Board’s plan to offer storage to wheat farmers is a step in the right direction owing to the huge losses they incur in post-harvest handling. Apart from reducing the losses, the growers will have room to negotiate for better prices since the vagaries of weather and limited technology have forced farmers to dispose of produce at low prices, exposing them to huge losses. It is also expected to encourage farmers to expand acreage and see more people entering the business, thereby helping Kenya to reduce leaning on imports that are killing local production. According to the NCPB, millers will be able to get the grains at Nakuru, Narok, Eldoret and Nairobi depots. It is a good start by the cereals agency, however the plan should be extended to more crops since post-harvest losses, estimated at more than 30 percent, cuts across. It is only when the harvest is well stored that farmers produce more, raising earnings and boosting the economy. We urge the NCPB to make it a long-term project and expand it other producer zones.
