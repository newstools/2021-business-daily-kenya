The SIM cards are available at Equity Bank branches. The launch comes at a time when the use of digital banking is growing driven by deepened customer shift to cashless transactions in the wake of Covid-19. Equitel registered 14 percent growth in customer transactions from 65.4 million in the first three months of 2021 compared to a similar quarter last year, according to Equity Group 2021 Q1 results. The value of transactions grew by 163 percent from Sh160.5 billion to Sh421.8 billion in the period. Equity Group posted a 64 percent jump to Sh8.7 billion in the quarter driven by strong growth in both interest and non-interest income.
