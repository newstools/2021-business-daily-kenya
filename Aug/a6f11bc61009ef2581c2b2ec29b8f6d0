 Hospitals have six days to start reporting new cancer cases to the National Cancer Institute of Kenya (NCI-Kenya) as the Ministry of Health seeks to collect accurate numbers on the disease. Kenya has been relying on estimates showing that deaths from the disease have risen to 32,987 every year and those newly diagnosed stand at 47,887, the Health ministry data shows. “The Institute notifies healthcare providers that beginning of 1st September 2021, they will be required, within 60 days of making a cancer diagnosis to make notification for purposes of maintaining the National Cancer Registry,” Health Secretary Mutahi Kagwe said in a public notice. David Makumi, a NCI-Kenya board member said doctors who fail to report face a fine not exceeding Sh200,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or to both.
