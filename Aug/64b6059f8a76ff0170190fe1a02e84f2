FILE PHOTO | NMG Auctioneers Monday stormed the home of Kirinyaga woman representative Purity Ngirici seeking to seize household items over a Sh5 million debt owed to a helicopter company. NCS Auctioneers stormed the Runda home in the morning following instructions from Flex Air Charters for failing to pay the money after hiring its helicopters in 2016. The auctioneers, however failed to cart away the items they had seized despite having a warrant and accompanied by police officers. It took the intervention of Murang’a senator Irungu Kang’ata to calm down things as he promised deliver a cheque to the auctioneers office. “Yes the lawyer (Mr Kangata) agreed to drop a check in our office,” Mr Timothy Owuor if NCS Auctioneers said. The MP hired the chopper services between May 8 and August 17, 2016 and incurred a cost of Sh5.9 million. She paid some amount and was left with a balance of Sh3.9 million. And after failing to pay the balance, the company moved to court seeking to compel the Kirinyaga woman representative and her husband to pay the debt. Lawyer Donald Kipkorir said the company won the case but the couple has refused to pay, forcing the company to instruct auctioneers.
