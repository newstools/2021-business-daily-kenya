 The proposed law barring landlords from auctioning the property of rent defaulters without court approval should aim for fairness. The government-backed Landlord and Tenant Bill of 2021 requires landlords to file a case at the Rent Tribunal and get ruling ahead of auction. This is a departure from the current Distress for Rent Act that empowers landlords to auction defaulters after issuing a 14-day notice. Tenants deserve to be protected especially given the many reports of brutal evictions and sale of their valuable property for a song over non-payment. While the change aims to save tenants from losing their valuables, the proposed law should ensure the rights of landlords are not neglected. For instance, the proposed law should give a timeline within which rent tribunals will listen and conclude disputes. In addition, there should be a provision to ensure tenants do not cart away their household goods as the case drags at the Rent Tribunal. Tribunals have been taking more than a year to conclude cases and if this is allowed to continue, it may embolden tenants to default on rent.
