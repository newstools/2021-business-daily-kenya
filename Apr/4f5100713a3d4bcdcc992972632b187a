Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha. NMG PHOTO Education Cabinet secretary George Magoha says the results for the 2020 Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) will be released by May 10. The 752,891 candidates sat their last paper Wednesday amid reports that some examination officials and civilians attempted to leak the tests ahead of the scheduled time. Some 27 officials including centre managers, supervisors and invigilators were relieved of their duties for examination malpractice. “I can confidently announce to the country that none of the 2020 KCSE examination papers was leaked, save for the unethical early exposure of questions, which was firmly dealt with and did not benefit any of the candidates,” said Prof Magoha yesterday. The names of the 27 teachers will be forwarded to the Teachers Service Commission (TSC) for further disciplinary action. Additionally, some 37 civilians, including three university students and two business owners, were arrested for attempting to assist in examination irregularities. Prof Magoha said 53 mobile phones were confiscated from candidates at examination rooms during the exercise. “Security agencies are currently conducting thorough forensic investigations to find out if the gadgets were used to aid any form of cheating,” he told journalists at Nairobi School after candidates sat their last paper. Last week, he disclosed that Adega Mixed and John Mbadi in Homa Bay, El-Hagarsu in Mandera, Kerongorori Mixed in Kisii, Huda Secondary in Garissa and Moro Secondary in Kisumu among exam centres where arrests had been made.
