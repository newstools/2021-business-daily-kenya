Education secretary Fred Matiang’i. FILE PHOTO | NMG Kenya has witnessed an upsurge in the misuse of licensed firearms in recent times that has forced the government to order the revocation of gun permits to those involved in shooting incidents. Now, Machanga Mareko, a psychiatrist and a firearms examiner at Kenyatta National Hospital, has petitioned the National Assembly to amend the Firearms Act to include mental check as a pre-condition for acquiring a firearm licence. While it is a step in the right direction, it is insufficient. Knee-jerk reactions won’t solve the gun violence problem. Part of the reason it has been difficult to curb misuse of firearms is that perpetrators include politicians with a mandate of making laws. Attempts for rigorous verification of all firearm certificates in private hands has been met by opposition from the civilian National Gun Owners Association. We need a complete overhaul of gun ownership regulation in tandem with improved policing if Kenya is to avoid the challenges the US, for example, faces with gun attacks and deaths. Police reforms should also be fast tracked to curtail the rising cases of officers turning the guns to fellow officers or civilians. Already, unchecked possession and circulation of small arms is a national security threat. Let’s act before it is too late.
