The House is currently in a month-long recess in compliance with new measures announced by President Uhuru Kenyatta to contain the third wave of coronavirus. Parliament public health officer Leah Kamweru in her briefing to the lawmakers said another vaccination drive for MPs is scheduled soon. Ms Kamweru also assured the National Assembly’s Committee on Members’ Services and Facilities that the Ministry of Health has enough vaccines for the lawmakers’ second vaccination. However, members of the committee pointed out that it does not make sense for them to be vaccinated while the people around them are not given the jab. “It is important that our staff, bodyguards, drivers and families are also vaccinated. It is important,” said Kibra MP Imran Okoth. “I may be vaccinated but what about my drivers and bodyguards?” Posed Awendo MP Walter Owino. Clerk of the National Assembly Michael Sialai said the number of vaccinated MPs could be higher since some made their private arrangements outside Parliament buildings.
