FILE PHOTO | NMG The National Environment Management Authority (Nema) has shut down a major slaughterhouse in Kitengela town over pollution and issued four abattoirs with new licences in a crackdown against non-compliant operators. The crackdown is the culmination of inspections that started four months ago but was slowed down by Covid-19 pandemic. The regulator had put 12 major slaughterhouses and a number of slaughter slabs across the county on its watchlist after uproar from the public over pollution. Kajiado Nema director Joseph Kopenjo said the private slaughterhouse in Kitengela would only be allowed back into business after complying with the regulations. "We are evaluating dozens of new application. So far four major slaughterhouses have complied and have been issued with Nema licences,” said Mr Kopejo. He added that Nema had taken issue with one of the Kiserian-based slaughter houses infamous for violating standards. "Our main focus is to ensure no affluent is discharged from the premises. We are not opposed to entrepreneurship but owners must fully comply," added Mr Kopejo. “Slaughterhouses must come up with plans to minimise air pollution. One slaughterhouse in Kiserian has embraced modern technology to recycle the waste for an income-generating venture.”
