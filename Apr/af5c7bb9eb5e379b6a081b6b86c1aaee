FILE PHOTO | NMG The Postal Corporation of Kenya (PCK) now wants the Senate to fast-track the approval of Sh1 billion that it requires annually to keep its branches open across the country in a bid to grow revenues. PCK, in a letter to the Senate Standing Committee on Information, Communication and Technology Wednesday said that the amount will help cushion the corporations’ universal service obligation. The loss-making parastatal that is currently struggling to stay afloat operates 640 post offices and partners with about 5,000 stamp vendor licensees across the country. “We are simply asking for money from the government to keep our operations going across the country. These branches cannot operate without funding,” said Postmaster-General Dan Kagwe. PCK also wants the committee to facilitate its appointment as the preferred government logistics service provider and be part of the newly established Kenya Transport and Logistics Network (KTLN).
