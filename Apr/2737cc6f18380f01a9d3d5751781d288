Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong. FILE PHOTO | NMG The Labour court has quashed governor Sospeter Ojaamong's decision to terminate appointment of three members of the Municipal Management Board earlier in the year. Justice Stephen Radido ruled that Mr John Kwoba, Ms Mary Magero and Mr Victor Khadondi were unlawfully terminated and ordered reinstatement to their positions. Through a January 13 letter dated, Mr Ojaamong informed the three of the termination saying there was need to comply with the provisions of the Urban Areas and Cities (Amendment) Act, 2019. A day after the termination, Busia County Government advertised the same vacancies, which prompted the three to move the court alleging breach of contract. The county government told court that the appointments were terminated because they did not meet the qualifications set out in Section 14 of the Urban Areas and Cities (Amendment) Act, 2019. Particularly, it argued that Mr Kwoba did not possess the minimum academic qualifications, Ms Magero was not a resident of the county while Mr Khadondi did not meet the age condition (youth representative). But the court ruled that lawwas clear on the grounds for terminatiin they didn't include those given by the county.
