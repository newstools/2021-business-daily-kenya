In notice on Monday, Garam auctioneers listed the eight-bedroom double storey residential house in Kawangware, Nairobi for sale. The property, which brings in Sh160,000 rental income a month, also includes four other single storey rental blocks comprising 17 single rooms, three toilets and two bathrooms. “Parcel of land known as L.R. No. Dagoretti/Riruta/s.499 Riruta Satellite Nairobi registered in the name of John Michael Njenga Mututho,” the notice for auction read. It is not clear which lender has put the former MPs property on the hammer but he has also defaulted on land rates, according to the notice. “The outstanding land rates and penalties were Sh165,590. Piped water and mains electricity services are connected,” the notice read. Mr Muthutho made a name for orchestrating the Alcohol Drinks Control Act known as ‘Mututho Laws,’ that limited sales of alcohol, bar and nightclub hours. He joins a list of prominent personalities who are facing auctions in the tough economy.
