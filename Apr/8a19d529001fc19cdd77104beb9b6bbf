The surge in demand is attributed to the recent lockdown that has seen the government restrict movement of people in and out of Nairobi and four other neighbouring counties to slow the spread of Covid-19 This cut off road and railway linking the coastal region and western Kenya. Initially, the carrier operated five flights weekly on the Eldoret-Kisumu-Mombasa route but this has since been upgraded to 11.The fares tend to be higher over the weekend when there is high demand for flying. For instance, a passenger travelling from Mombasa to Eldoret and Kisumu to Mombasa last week Friday paid Sh15,100 for one way with the weekdays cost ranging between Sh10,100 and Sh13,100. Before the new lockdown, jambojet was a charging a low of Sh8, 000 on the Mombasa, West Kenya direct flights. “We have maintained the flights that we had added on the route during Easter because the demand is still there,” said the airline. “We see that people who used to connect via Nairobi are now flying direct because of restriction on movement in and out of Nairobi, keeping up the demand on these routes,” it added. The airline said it is keen on increasing the number of passengers on the route as it seeks to encourage the use of air travel. Railway and road connection between western Kenya and the coastal region remains suspended following a presidential directive a fortnight ago on Covid lockdown.
