FILE PHOTO | NMG It is inconceivable that more than seven months after the government started collecting money from motorists, it has still not put in place the mechanism to roll out the diesel subsidy even as prices continue to rise. Instead the Petroleum and Mining Cabinet Secretary has warned of another rise in prices this month will only make it worse. The ministry, he said, will take another month to craft regulations backing the rollout of the subsidy, before submission for parliamentary approval. The question remains therefore why the government started levying the Sh5.40 per litre fees on motorists without putting in place the mechanism for deployment of the money when fuel prices went up. Have the funds been ring-fenced for other purposes once they hit the exchequer? It is only fair to ask that the government stops collecting more funds under the plan until such a time when it is ready to roll out the relief. This will also push those responsible for crafting the regulations for the rollout of the subsidy to approach their work with urgency.
