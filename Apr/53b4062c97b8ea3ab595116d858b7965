The cost of a 90-kilogramme (kg) bag of maize has crossed the Sh3,000 mark for the first time since beginning of the year, from a low of Sh2,500 previously following restrictions on grain coming in from Uganda. Mr Joseph Karuri, chairman of the Association of Kenya Animal Feeds Manufacturers said the cost of animal meals would be reviewed following the sharp rise in the maize price. “We have witnessed a sharp hike in the cost of maize within a very short time with the price of raw material across the board going up by 40 percent,” he said. “For example the price of a 70kg bag of dairy meal last year in April was Sh2,000. The current price is now Sh2,600,” he added. Mr Karuri said urged the government to review the import restriction, noting that it had plunged most millers into cash flow problems. “The government should find a way to resolve the dispute at the borders in respect to the maize imports from our neighbours so that the reduced prices will benefit the farmers,” he said. Mr Karuri said most millers are at the moment concerned with breaking even to pay their workers and keep on running their entities other than making profit. Processors are also grappling with an increase in cost of key supplements such as sunflower cake that has gone up from Sh18 last year in April to Sh45 for a kilo. Soya has increased from Sh55 to Sh80 for the same quantity with a kilo of wheat bran going up from Sh12 to Sh23. Most of these supplements are imported from Tanzania, Uganda and Malawi, and a weaker shilling against the dollar has made the matters worse.
