The 800 square foot at Oltalet Mall branch is the tenth the dealer has opened during the Covid-19 pandemic, which it says is driven by public demand. Head of retail Wazeem Mohamed says the shop would help Optica’s optometrists to offer correct eye diagnosis and advise customers. “Our expansion is because of the need that is there since eye-care remains a necessity despite the pandemic,” he says. In the past year, the dealer has opened branches at Capital Centre and Point Mall in Buruburu, Nairobi. Other new outlets are in Kisumu, Likoni and Diani. Optica stocks a range of frames and sunglasses at a friendly price, which it says is meant to provide the public with more options and shield them from quarks. The family-owned business started more than 60 years ago currently offers all major ophthalmic lens brands and stocks different frames with some retailing for as little as Sh890. “We offer a frame at 890 and a pair of lenses at 800, meaning one can get a pair for as little as Sh1,690 that comes with warranty against any manufacturing defect,” says Mr Mohamed. Some 10 years ago, Optica ventured into making its eyewear, launching a brand called Oxygene in the local market while continuing to stock international brands. The Oxygene brand had been customised to fit African face shapes, the company said. It later introduced the Cactus brand, to build on the success of the first innovation. “Our lenses are similarly priced while not compromising on quality, which unfortunately is not the case with competitors we have come across,” says Mr Wazeem.
