Technicians repair power lines. FILE PHOTO | NMG Kenya Power #ticker:KPLC, the electricity distribution monopoly, has dropped the intention to increase bills at a time it is struggling with rising costs and unpaid bills of more than Sh27 billion. In a change of tack, the company says it will now focus on recovering the huge bills, curbing electricity theft tied to illegal connections, and lowering payments to power generators. Vivianne Yeda, the Kenya Power chairperson, says it would not make sense to burden the consumers further by increasing the charges. It is a change of plan that makes business sense. High power costs have been cited by homes and businesses as the impediment to growth. It is also worth noting that consumers are now opting for the cheaper solar power alternative, a shift that will be more painful to Kenya Power. A sustainable Kenya Power is one whose operations run with as few hitches as possible while its customers’ expectations are met and exceeded. The listed power firm ought to focus on a strategy that makes shareholders, electricity users, and power generators happy for its flawless operations and growth.
