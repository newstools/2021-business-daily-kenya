The terminal, which has been under construction since last year, has had its opening pushed forward a number of times. However, Nairobi Metropolitan Services (NMS) announced that it will conduct a three-hour test run at the matatu terminus as its commissioning nears. NMS Director-General Major General Mohamed Badi said the test run was necessary to assess the level of preparedness of all stakeholders ahead of commissioning of the facility. The terminus, located at the former Lunar Park, is a drop-off and pick-up point for matatus plying the Ngong and Lang’ata routes, all currently operating from the Nairobi Railways Central station. “This notice therefore, informs the general public that all public service vehicles (PSVs) operating from the Nairobi Railway Station Frontage will do a test run of dropping passengers at the Green Park terminals on Tuesday, April 27, 2021 between 6am and 9am,” read in part the public notice.
