The site, which houses over 1,000 MSEs will act as a common user facility with machinery to support innovation and exhibition for the enterprises. The move is part of the Authority’s plan to improve jua kali sites and boost production through provision of electricity, sanitation facilities and expansion. “By providing common user facilities and equipment, we are helping to boost production, quality and efficiency in the sector amidst the current challenges brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic,” Mr Henry Rithaa, MSEA chief executive said. In addition to the work sites, MSEA has also refurbished and equipped 120 Constituency Industrial Development Centres across the country with 58 more set for the refurbishment this financial year ending June. The authority said it will soon be registering the enterprises in subsectors including agro-processing, garments, the assembly of automotive components and electronics, plastics, paper, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, metals and engineering products for domestic and export markets including government supplying. “We are working with other stakeholders in the public and private sector to provide innovative solutions that will unlock liquidity and provide working capital to cushion and revive the sector even as the pandemic evolves,” said Mr Rithaa. Manufacturing has been among sectors negatively impacted by the coronavirus pandemic due to slowed activity and demand. The sector contracted by 3.2 per cent in the quarter ending September 2020 compared to 3.9 percent growth in the corresponding quarter of 2019.
