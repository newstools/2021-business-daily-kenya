The balance of trade between the two nations heavily favours the United Arab Emirates (UAE), with Kenya mainly exporting tea, spices, goat meat, coffee and fresh cut flowers and importing petroleum fuels, manufactured articles, textiles plastics and electronic goods from the Middle East nation. Kenya’s exports to the UAE stood at Sh19.2 billion last year, against Sh92.7 billion imports, making it the third largest exporter to Kenya after China and India. “The agency seeks to gain insights on key products that present a high growth potential in the market so as to develop strategies that will enable us to penetrate the market and grow our exports to the UAE,” Keproba said in a notice. Dubai, as the commercial and trading hub of the Middle East, has long been regarded as the gateway to the rest of the world. Last month, Kenyan fresh produce exporters, who had been complaining of non-payment for orders from the UAE, got a boost when Dubai’s export insurance provider agreed in a deal brokered by the Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry to cover for losses where buyers default on already exported goods. This has raised hopes of higher volumes and earnings from the market. Overall, Kenya is ranked 21st among African exporters to the Middle East, accounting for 1.3 percent of Africa’s total exports to the Middle East.
