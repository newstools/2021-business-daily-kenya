FILE PHOTO | NMG The Covid-19 National Emergency Response Committee is expected to meet today to decide on the next steps regarding the high number of infections in India. Sunday, the cases hit more than 300,000 as hospitals turned away people on shortage oxygen. According to the Health Cabinet Secretary, it is this meeting that will decide whether Kenya is imposing travel restrictions between the two countries. This review is happening at a time countries such as the US, Britain, New Zealand, France, Singapore and Canada have either banned flights to that country or tightened isolation. Kenya ought to take a decisive step early in efforts to protect the country from the sweeping second wave in India. Suspending flights should be the next step without delay. Kenyan citizens should get the appropriate cover from the disease that has brought the world economy to its knees. The flight restrictions should be the right thing to do considering Kenya’s capacity in terms of vaccination, isolation facilities and the number of health personnel. It should not be worse than this.
