It shouldn’t be about selfish politicians looking for ways to line their pockets while condemning taxpayers to poor services and infrastructure. The County Assembly has slashed the budget of the National Metropolitan Services (NMS) for the financial year ending June 30, 2022 by Sh5.92 billion despite the agency handling most of the devolved roles in the city. The NMS handles health, transport, public works and county government planning and development which are the key roles of devolved units. In the revised County Fiscal Strategy Paper passed by the County Assembly last week, the NMS will get Sh21.18 billion for the transferred functions. The overall spending has been increased by Sh1.9 billion to Sh39.6 billion from the current Sh37.7 billion. MCAs should funnel money to sectors that will bolster economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. The critical areas include health and infrastructure that are under the NMS.
