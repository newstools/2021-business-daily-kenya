The new appointee will take over from Mercy Karogo who has been acting CEO since the dismissal of nine top officials, including her predecessor Joseph Kivilu. In an advert in the dailies, Knec board said it is looking for a self-driven, fair, innovative, firm, dynamic and results oriented leader. Former Education CS Fred Matiang’i appointed Dr Karogo alongside his now Education colleague George Magoha as the Knec chairman to restore the integrity of the examination organisation. “The Kenya National Examination Council has been going through a strategic and transformation change management process since 2016,” read the notice. Dismissal of Knec’s top officials came just days following an explosive report from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations which detailed how the 2015 KCSE was leaked by a network of cartels involving the Knec officers. During Mr Kivilu’s reign at the Knec, the country witnessed the highest number of cancelled KCSE results. Over 5,000 students were affected.
