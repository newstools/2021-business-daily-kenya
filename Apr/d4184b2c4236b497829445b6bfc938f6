Parliament during a past session. FILE PHOTO | NMG Lawmakers are seeking express authority from the Senate Speaker to travel out of Nairobi and question governors on audit queries amid a freeze on movement into and out of the capital city. The Senate County Public Accounts and Investments Committee (CPAIC) said the ban imposed on physical meetings posed a challenge to their work. They said it was impossible for the committee, which scrutinises voluminous documents in support of audit queries, to hold virtual sittings to grill governors. “Unless we get an exemption, virtual meetings will not add value to our work,”Mr Ochilo Ayako, chairperson of CPAIC said. The committee is seeking to hold meetings in clusters of counties outside the disease zone of Nairobi, Kajiado, Machakos, Kiambu and Nakuru. Last month Senate and National Assembly Speakers imposed a ban on all physical meetings and directed committees to only hold sessions virtually. “In line with the measures instituted by the President for the containment of the spread of the pandemic, I direct that all meetings of Select Committees of the Senate will only take place virtually,” Senate speaker Kenneth Lusaka ruled. The directive followed the decision by President Uhuru Kenyatta to impose lockdown on the five counties he termed as a disease zone. Parliament adjourned its sittings for a month on Tuesday following a request to Parliament by Mr Kenyatta to suspend their sittings until such a time that the rate of infection is brought under control.
