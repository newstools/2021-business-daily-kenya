Acting Health Chief Officer Greggory Ganda said the plant will be shipped from the US and installed at Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital next month. Kenya is suffering from an acute shortage of medical oxygen in hospitals as severe Covid-19 cases threaten to overwhelm the healthcare system. Demand for oxygen for Covid-19 related emergencies has more than doubled to about 880 tonnes from 410 tonnes last year and 560 tonnes in January, reflecting elevated third-wave infections. “We hope to receive the equipment between end of May and early June. It is expected to double our capacity,” said Dr Ganda. At least 50 patients require oxygen on a daily basis from the biggest referral hospital in western Kenya. “Going forward, we don’t expect to have cases where patients will die due to lack of oxygen in our facility,” he said. This comes as Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o expressed concern over the rising number of cases. “The meeting of the multi-agency Covid-19 committee was shocked by the statistics. Covid-19 pandemic is on a furious phase and is killing our people more than ever before,” he said during the relaunch of toll-free call centre. In a speech read by Deputy Governor Mathews Owili, the county chief said that Kisumu had recorded 2,606 cumulative positive cases from some 28,705 tests.
