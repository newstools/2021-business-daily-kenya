The self-service platform unveiled in August 2020 currently allows customers to check electricity bills, buy tokens, report a power outage and other incidents. The utility firm is now mulling adding more features on the platform, which it says is based on customer feedback. “Services under consideration to be added to the self-service menu are; tracking of the progress on complaint resolution, tracking the progress of new electricity connection application, conversion of the menu into Kiswahili,” said Waceke Mbugua, customer experience manager at Kenya Power. The platform comprises two services, including the MyPower app that is available on Android and IOS as well as USSD Code *977#. It was introduced to ride on technology to enhance service delivery and came at a time customers were complaining about estimated or inaccurate billing. Additional services offered by the self-service platform include self-reading that allows postpaid customers to read their electricity meters and conveniently submit the readings to Kenya Power through their mobile phones for accurate billing. It also enables users to check the authenticity of Kenya Power employees by querying their staff numbers to determine whether they are genuine staff or imposters. The utility firm says there has been a significant drop in human traffic at its banking hall since the introduction of the platform as customers send in queries remotely. Data from Kenya Power shows currently, on average there are 550,000 and 1.7 million interactions on the app and USSD code, respectively monthly.
