Education CS George Magoha. FILE PHOTO | NMG More than 20 individuals including school heads were arrested for leaking ongoing Kenya National Secondary Education (KCSE) to candidates ahead of scheduled time. Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha said Wednesday the arrests were made in Homa Bay, Garissa, Mandera, Kisii, and Kisumu counties. The parpetrators include centre managers (school principals), supervisors and invigilators. They are accused of exposing the contents of examination papers once released in the morning to the schools. “I wish to assure the country that these attempts to access the exams have not interfered with the credibility of the exams as the exposed questions were never accessed by the candidates,” said Prof Magoha. Exam centres where arrests have been made include Adega Mixed and John Mbadi in Homa Bay, El-Hagarsu in Mandera, Kerongorori Mixed in Kisii, Huda Secondary in Garissa and Moro Secondary in Kisumu. The malpractice is said to have happened between the times the examination papers leave the distribution centres (metallic containers) and when they arrive at the examination centre. The first batch of 752,891 candidates sitting the 2020 KCSE cleared on Monday (April, 12) with the rest expected to conclude on April 21.
