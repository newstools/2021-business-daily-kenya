Mr Edwin Kiama at the Nairobi court. PHOTO | DENNIS ONSONGO | NMG Police want a Nairobi court to allow detention of an activist suspected to be behind a poster circulated on social media platforms indicating that President Uhuru Kenyatta is not authorised to act or transact on behalf of Kenyans. In an application filed at a magistrate court in Milimani, detectives said holding Mr Edwin Mutemi Kiama for 14 days will give them ample time to complete investigations. Mr Kiama is accused of contravening various provisions of the Computer Misuse and Cybercrime Act, including false publication. He said preliminary investigations had showed that two twitter handles which made the publication of the poster are linked to Mr Kiama. The poster emerged as Kenyans expressed diverse opinions on the government's decision to borrow money from the International Monetary Fund. The publication was to the effect that "this is to notify the world at large that the person whose photograph and names appear above is not authorised to act or transact on behalf of the citizens of the republic of Kenya and that the nation and future generations shall not be held liable for any penalties of bad loans negotiated and/or borrowed by him”. The court will rule on the application today.
