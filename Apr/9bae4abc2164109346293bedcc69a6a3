Cabinet Secretary Simon Chelugui. FILE PHOTO | NMG The proposal by the Ministry of Labour to have part of the Sh257 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) paid as stipends to Kenyans who have lost their jobs due to the pandemic is commendable. A number of countries, the US, Canada, Denmark and Sweden, have offered Covid-19 relief packages directly to workers and households struggling to put food on the table. Closer home, South Africa had a similar programme, which helped reduce the suffering of citizens thrown out of employment as companies resorted to hiring freeze, unpaid leaves and job cuts to survive the pandemic The latest restrictions introduced by the Kenyan government last month have raised fears of a second wave of job losses and pay cuts across sectors. Economic recovery witnessed in the last quarter of 2020 and first quarter of this year was not enough to offset the losses experienced last year. Consequently, many Kenyans are still faced with a myriad economic problems that won’t just disappear without proper intervention by the State. The programme, however, should not be a new conduit to embezzle public funds, as has been the case in the past. Public officials have developed the tendency of introducing ideas that can uplift the lives of poor citizens only to rob them at the end. If approved, this initiative should serve its intended purpose.
