The request by the Ministry of Defence for the meat processor to be exempted from the list of parastatals earmarked for privatisation should be backed up by workable plans. While KDF is counting on the Sh4 billion Treasury allocation to the cash-strapped meat plant, this cannot be the only basis to drop the privatisation plan. KMC, just like many other parastatals, has over the years received taxpayers money but has little to show for it. KDF must therefore look beyond just money in trying to turn around the abattoir that was handed to it last September through an executive order. It must, for instance, provide a breakdown of their plans for KMC and the period within which it hopes to turn the meat processor around. The level of dislcosures must also be raised. Taxpayers deserve to know how the entities they fund are operating. Bad governance lapses and opaqueness in the use of taxpayers’ money has made the revival of such parastatals difficult.
