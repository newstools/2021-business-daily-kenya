Parliament during a past session. FILE PHOTO | NMG Are scandals involving loss of taxpayers’ money not so many in Kenya? Aren’t related investigations equally many? Aren’t Members of Parliament vetting nominees to key positions as stipulated in the Constitution? Indeed, requirements for key positions keep rising in attempts to give the taxpayers the tried and tested. This vetting is on live television. Those that are not live are monitored by a battery of journalists who file detailed reports, including the candidate’s assets and liabilities, where they went to school, and the top jobs they have held. So, the search for talent is a life-and-death business in Kenya, thanks to the requirements of the 2010 Constitution whose midwifing cost lives and consumed huge budgets. It is a celebrated document, here in Kenya and in foreign lands as one that was well debated, crafted and passed. It is now a decade since it was promulgated. But what has changed in terms of good governance? Sadly, the number of scandals every time Kenya is faced with a life-threatening event and a huge budget is required such as the Covid-19 situation is mind-boggling. The country must ask itself whether the people in charge or every Kenyan for that matter read this beautiful Constitution? This Constitution’s Chapter Six on leadership and integrity is the reference for State agencies such as the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC), the Auditor-General, the Directorate of Criminal Investigations, and the Judiciary when judging, advising, and punishing. Why are Kenyans not respecting a document they laboured to produce? When the team reviewing the Constitution delivered its draft at Bomas of Kenya, there was song and dance across the country with citizens and Kenya’s partners expecting a rebirth. What, then, has happened that rot and looting is going on with abandon under the watch of people who know how to read the Constitution and are expected to understand constitutionalism?
