The two signed the renewable, three-year memorandum of understanding (MoU) which will provide Kepsa members access to the Canadian market for investment and trade as well as CACB memberships in the country. “This MoU will solidify the existing trade relations between Kenya and Canada and establish strong bonds between the two countries that will go a long way to boost private sector trade and investment,” said Kepsa chief executive officer Carole Karuga. “It will also enable us to exchange business information with CACB which is critical especially to our members who wish to expand their coverage to international market.” The agreement was signed during the second session of the Binational Commission meeting between the Kenya and Canadian governments. The pact now paves way for a virtual trade mission to Kenya from Canada in May. “The joint intended results of the co-operation agreement between CACB and Kepsa seeks to increase two-way trade and investment between Canada and Kenya in all sectors ,” CACB Chair Sebastian Spio-Garbrah said. Last month, Kenya formally joined the 27-year old independent, not-for-profit CACB as a full time member. The chamber brings on board key African decision makers such as ministers and head of states, investors, entrepreneurs and policy makers. The pact is expected to help bridge Kenya’s trade deficit with Canada that stood at Sh11 billion in 2019, where exports stood at Sh2.9 billion and imports Sh13.9 billion.
