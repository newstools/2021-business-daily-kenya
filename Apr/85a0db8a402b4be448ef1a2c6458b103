The standards, according to industry players, will go a long way in seeking markets for the crop. According to the draft regulations seen by the Business Daily, the standards of procedures of practice include ensuring hygiene is observed in the entire chain from harvesting to packaging as well as loading into vehicles and aircraft. The Kebs says the Kenya Code of Practice for the Miraa (Khat) Industry has been developed by the national workshop on miraa under the guidance of the Standards Projects Committee. “This code stipulates the hygienic and safety requirements during the production, handling and marketing of miraa. The standard also considers the safety provisions for consumers and workers in the industry,” the agency says in the preliminary draft, adding: Nyambene Miraa Traders Association chairman Kimathi Munjuri hailed the move as historic. “We are starting to see the results of years of struggle to ensure the government secures market for miraa which the Ministry of Agriculture recognises as a scheduled crop just like tea or coffee,” he told the Business Daily yesterday. “We request the standards agency to fast track the process so that the government can start marketing the crop internationally.”
