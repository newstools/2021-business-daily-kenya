The Sh6.75 million project will benefit six wards and is aimed at promoting dairy production. According to County Executive Member for Agriculture, Irrigation, Livestock and Fisheries Gilchrist Okuom, the county has so far purchased and distributed 45 dairy cows. He pointed out that milk production was not optimal despite recently establishing the Osiepe dairy center in Muhoroni with a capacity of 10,000 daily milk cooling. “We envisage to work at optimum to improve nutritional status of our people, reduce milk importation and to improve access and consequently reduce the cost of milk within the county,” he said. The purchase of dairy cows is an addition to the 454 cows bought previously in 2017, said the CEC. Mr Okuom indicated 12 cows were distributed in Masogo Nyang'oma, North Nyakach (8), South East Nyakach (16), South West Nyakach (7) and one each for Seme and Kajulu. He pointed that the move is part of an initiative aimed at assisting farmers to upgrade their stock and increase milk production. “The Livestock directorate has endeavored to empower the farmers to upgrade from cattle herders to dairy farmers where there are high returns depending on the effort put in production,” said Mr Okuom. To improve and sustain dairy production in the county, the directorate has applied strategies such as the fixed time artificial insemination on local breed and bringing in heifers to be bred by farmers. This is intended to give a superior breed in terms of genetic composition and for better production of both meat and milk.
