Insurance Regulatory Authority CEO Godfrey Kiptum. FILE PHOTO | NMG The planned insurance cover for thousands of workers seeking overseas employment in regions such as the Middle East and Asia is a welcome move. The growing diaspora remittances, which last year averaged Sh6.33 billion weekly despite Covid-19 economic hardships, speaks to the importance of migrant workers. Many of the workers in the informal sector are missing out on social protection programmes such as public health cover. Some are sponsored to work overseas by unregistered agencies, making them vulnerable. An insurance cover will be key in improving their welfare. The Insurance Regulatory Authority should speed up the process of establishing the cover that will help many of the bottom of pyramid Kenyans. The government should update its record of Kenyans working overseas to enable development a suitable insurance cover. Kenyans are present in most regions of the world, including Asia, the Middle East, Latin America, the Caribbean and Oceania. But the State does not have a reliable and timely labour market information.
