FILE PHOTO | NMG The Kenya National Highway Authority (KeNHA) has pushed back the starting date of the 63-kilometre sugar belt road construction, citing approvals delay. KeNHA Director–General Peter Mundinia was optimistic that the permits would be secured within the next week paving the way for works to start on the project that traverses Kisumu, Nandi and Kericho counties. Initially, the project was set to start last October. The road that runs through Chemelil, Miwani and Kibos before joining the Kisumu–Kakamega road at the Mamboleo junction traverses three major sugar cane millers and has been in bad shape for more than two decades. “We are in the process of getting all the required approvals which is the reason why works on the project is yet to start,” said Mr Mundinia. Once works on the project starts, it will be completed under one year since it traverses a fairly level terrain and straight alignment, according to descriptions detailing its implementation plans. The scope includes the dualling of Mamboleo/A1 intersection to Great Lakes University together with service lanes, pedestrian walkway and provision of street lighting around the area.
