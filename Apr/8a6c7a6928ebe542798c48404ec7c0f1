PHOTO | NMG Edible oil manufacturer Bidco has lost a bid to take over the prosecution of its former employees for theft from the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). High Court judge Mary Kasango dismissed the case saying the prosecutorial power is vested in the DPP and that once the chief prosecutor has commenced prosecution, he cannot be directed in the exercise of his power. Private prosecution is allowed in law but in Bidco’s case, the five suspects were charged only for the hearing to delay for four years, prompting the company to seek the court’s permission to take over the matter. “To permit a party to take over prosecution of a case commenced by DPP would be equivalent to allowing DPP to be directed in his prosecutorial power. Section 28 of ODPP Act only permits a private prosecutor to commence private prosecution. It does not permit taking over of DPP’s prosecution,” the judge said. Bidco accused the DPP of delaying the case, despite having sufficient evidence. The former employees, Kennedy Mutinda, James Kwendo, Robert Ambonyo, Alex Kinaka and Isaac Kitonga were charged with stealing before a Thika court on August 11, 2016 and released on bail. Bidco said it was unable to recover the lost money because of the DPP’s complacency in handling the matter. The company had argued that a private citizen can institute private prosecution where the court is satisfied that there has been a failure by the bodies charged with prosecution to carry out their mandate. But the DPP dismissed the accusation of delay saying at one time in May 2019, the prosecution was ready to proceed with the trial and had brought three witnesses only for the company to apply to take over the case.
