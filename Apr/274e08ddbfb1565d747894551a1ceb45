 A court has rescued property attached from a university over unpaid union dues and agency fees amounting to Sh13.4 million. The Employement and Labour Relations Court temporarily suspended the sale of movable property attached by Mbusera Auctioneers on March 11,2021 from the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT). The university moved to court under a certificate of urgency then obtained orders stopping Mbusera Auctioneers from selling by public auction assorted movable property it had attached. JKUAT said it had paid the amount in dispute. But lawyer Titus Koceyo for Universities Academic Staff Union (Uasu) has told the Business Daily that the union is contesting the claim. The court directed the university lawyers to serve the suit papers on Uasu to enable it respond to the issues raised within 15 days. The presiding judge directed parties to file all responses and written submissions before a date of making final remarks ahead of the judgment. Mbusera Auctioneers carted away JKUAT movable properties on March 11, 2021 to sell them through a public auction to recover Sh13,424,639 it owes Uasu. The attached properties were to be sold after March 25, 2021. Justice Maureen Onyango allowed the auctioneers to attach the property belonging to JKUAT on March 11,2021. “You are hereby commanded you to attach the movable property of the said judgement debtor as set out in the schedule hereunto,” the judge directed Mbusera Auctioneer managing director Mr RW Mbuthia. Properties attached include three motor vehicles worth Sh8 million, student desks and chairs ( Sh600,000), 100 office desks, 400 office chairs, 30 filing cabinets, 100 telephone heads, 16 photocopiers,300 computers, lab equipment and fridges. Uasu filed a case against seven public universities seeking Sh123 million in unremitted dues and agency fees. Six other universities paid their deductions.
