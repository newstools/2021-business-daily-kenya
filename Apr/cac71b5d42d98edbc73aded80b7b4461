President Uhuru Kenyatta. FILE PHOTO | NMG When President Uhuru Kenyatta released the new Covid-19 lockdown measures, many questions followed. The reactions targeted tax measures that go with the reduced economic capacity due to restricted movement. Last week the President clarified that any protections will be sector-based and he mentioned hospitality and entertainment whose captains have been fighting to have the lockdown rules relaxed. Indeed, for the first time, people protested, asking the head of State to ensure the country was not pushed to a rut where jobs would be lost and earnings affected as happened the better part of last year. We ask the government to follow up the President’s word with action, including consultative meeting s with the business leaders and effectively monitor activities to ensure the reliefs come at the right time and capture the needs. Having said that, it is upon every Kenyan to adhere to the Covid-containment protocols such that the country does not find itself in a tough condition at a time the infection rates were at double-digits. On this, it is also upon the corporates to train their workers to obey the rules of keeping distance, washing hands with soap, and sanitising hands. Kenyans’ patriotism, in one way or another, is now tied to protecting one’s neighbour, colleague or a fellow passenger from this disease.
