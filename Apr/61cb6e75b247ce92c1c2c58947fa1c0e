FILE PHOTO | NMG Jambojet has partnered with hotels at the coast to lure travellers from western Kenya to the region after visitor numbers drastically fell following the March lock-down of five Covid-19 infested counties. The budget carrier has unveiled a Sh15,300 package which comprises a return ticket from Eldoret-Kisumu-Mombasa with a three- day accommodation on full board. The offer is targeting passengers from the North Rift and Nyanza regions where Jambojet is at the moment operating direct flights between the western towns Eldoret and Kisumu to Mombasa. “Hotels at the coast have created flying packages to lure potential customers from the North Rift and western Kenya regions. Baobab Beach Resort, Diani Sea Lodge, Plaza Beach Hotel, Sarova Whitesands and Plan Hotels are offering attractive packages,” said Jambojet head of sales and marketing Titus Titus Oboogi. The offer dubbed ‘from lakeside to the seaside’ runs from April 16 to June 30 and will also see visitors get additional incentives such as staying for four nights after paying for three. This is the latest initiative for both the carrier and the hospitality industry to boost their numbers after Covid-19 restrictions hit their businesses. The carrier said recently that there have been a surge in demand for passengers seeking to travel on either side of the country. The surge follows the five-county lockdown that effectively cut road and railway connection between the coast and western Kenya.
