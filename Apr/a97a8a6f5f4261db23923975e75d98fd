FILE PHOTO | NMG The government is yet to decide on the request for disposal of five non-core assets by the National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) to raise funds to implement its new mandate. NCPB board chairman Mutea Iringo told the National Assembly’s Agriculture Committee that the board requires Sh24.3 billion to effect its plans. “The implementation of the 2020/2023 strategic plan will require funding to the tune of Sh24.3 billion, which will be sourced largely from the liquidation of the government debts, borrowings and disposal of non-core assets. “The request for disposal on five non-core assets is currently under consideration within government following NCPB’s board of directors’ approval of the same,” he told the Silas Tiren-chaired committee. Mr Iringo said the board is faced with challenges including low working capital and dilapidated infrastructure that require the funds to fix. “The estimated cost of refurbishment and modernising the key locations is Sh1.8 billion and loan taken to support the government fertiliser subsidy programme that is attracting high-interest rates at 22.5 per cent per month which has a major impact on the overall profitability of the institution,” said Mr Iringo.
