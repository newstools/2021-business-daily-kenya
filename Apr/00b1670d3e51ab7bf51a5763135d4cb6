The Judicial Service Commission (JSC) has rushed to the Court of Appeal to overturn a ruling stopping it from conducting interviews to fill the vacant position of a Supreme Court judge. JSC also said it was dissatisfied with the Wednesday ruling by three judges, which also barred it from deliberating and forwarding the name of the successful candidate for the position of Chief Justice to President Kenyatta for the appointment. “Take notice that the respondent herein being dissatisfied with the ruling delivered on March 21, 2021, intends to appeal to the Court of Appeal against the whole of the said ruling,” the notice by JSC stated. Justices Anthony Mrima, Wilfrida Okwany and Reuben Nyakundi allowed the commission to conclude the interviews for the candidates seeking to become the next CJ but barred JSC from forwarding the name until the case is determined. The three judges said there is ample time for JSC to approach the Court of Appeal before the orders issued on Wednesday take effect. Three petitions were filed challenging the interviews with Tolphin Nafula, Philip Thuita, Damaris Wakiuru and Memba Ocharo challenging Prof Olive Mugenda chairing the JSC panel.
