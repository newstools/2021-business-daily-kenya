The Committee on Implementation of House Resolutions has written to Speaker Justin Muturi, who also chairs the Powers and Privileges Committee to open an independent inquiry into the bribery claims. “We have resolved to write to the Powers and Privileges Committee to take up the matter of alleged bribery. We want Mohan Galot, the chairman of LDK, to be summoned to provide names of MPs, their proxies, relatives and companies that received the alleged houses,” said Moitalel ole Kenta. The 14-member Powers and Privileges Committee is mandated by Section 15 of the Parliamentary Powers and Privileges Act 2017 to investigate complaint made by any person, inquire into the conduct of a member alleged to constitute breach of privilege and report to the House its findings.
