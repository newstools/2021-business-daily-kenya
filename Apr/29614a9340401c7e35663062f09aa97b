The hitch, which started Sunday evening, was preventing customer transactions including bill queries, token purchases and payment of bills, until 1pm on Monday when it was resolved. Many customers took to social media to complain about the inconvenience — the second time this month — with Kenya Power also missing out on electricity sales. “We wish to inform our customers that we have resumed critical business operations as of 1pm this (Monday) afternoon,” said the utility. “Customers can now purchase prepaid tokens via 88880 and make their postpaid bill payments via 888888. We are still sending out tokens that were delayed by service interruption.” Customers who tried buying tokens through Kenya Power’s paybill number 888880 were informed the “organisation receiving the payment is unavailable”. The technical hitch means that businesses that use electricity to run their activities and had not purchased power before the problem set in could not continue with their operations. Households that use electricity for activities such as cooking, lighting and running small businesses such as home baking also felt the inconvenience. The hitch also translates into lost sales for Kenya Power, which last year sold 8,171 gigawatt-hours (GWh) or 22.4 GWh per day. Kenya Power has been struggling to reduce idle electricity at a time power producers supplied it with an all-time high 1.058 billion kilowatt-hours in March. The utility firm last year failed to sell about 24.26 per cent of the power or 2.817 billion kWh it bought from generators like Kenya Electricity Generating Company #ticker:KEGN. The excess generation has been a major concern for Kenya Power, which has to pay for the electricity generated even when there is no market to sell it.
