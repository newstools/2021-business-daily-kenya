Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Peter Munya said following the adoption of the Kenya Dairy Industry Regulations 2021, processors should not pay farmers less than Sh33, even when a glut hits the market. Currently, processors are paying on average Sh40 a litre because of the shortage of milk in the market, although stocks are expected to build up with onset of the long rains. The regulations are good news for farmers, especially after processors paid as low as Sh19 per litre last year, citing increases volumes in the market. The CS said such occurrences will now be a thing of the past as the new law will guide pricing in the sector, denying processors an opportunity of reducing the prices at will. Mr Munya added that under the new regulations, the minimum price will be reviewed every six months to ensure farmers get the most from their enterprise.Other reforms introduced by the dairy regulator include capping the amount that cooperative societies can deduct from farmers to Sh2 per litre to protect producers’ earnings. Processors have been pegging the price of the commodity on supply and demand with the new directive now likely to favour the farmer. Data from Kenya Dairy Board showed milk volumes declined by 0.95 per cent last year to hit 679 million litres, down from 685 million litres in 2019. This was the first time that production of milk in the country has dropped in the last three years, on account of unstable weather that led to insufficient feed.
