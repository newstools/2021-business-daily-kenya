In their appeal, the county secretaries want the court to overturn a Labour court's decision to dismiss their petition in which they wanted SRC to uphold the salary perks promised by the now defunct Transition Authourity (TA) in 2013. Court documents indicate that TA had proposed remuneration at a scale of Sh152,060 to Sh302,980 per month plus house allowance of Sh70,000 and Sh24,000 as commuter allowance per month. The remuneration was equivalent to a public officer in Job Group T. Indeed, they state that the successful applicants for positions of county secretaries signed contracts with the counties on Job Group T as terms of engagement. However, few months after assuming office, SRC advised that they should be paid between Sh135,000 and Sh180,000 as basic salary, Sh70,000 as house allowance and between Sh20,000 and Sh50,000 in other allowances. In July 2014 SRC made another review and consolidated their salaries to range between consolidated gross figure of Sh225,000 to Sh300,000.
