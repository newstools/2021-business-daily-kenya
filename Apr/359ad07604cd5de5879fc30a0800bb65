The new outlet is located along the main street, Kenyatta Avenue, and brings the retailer’s branch network to 71. Naivas, just like collapsed Nakumatt and struggling Tuskys, traces its root in Nakuru before its expansion countrywide. Tuskys shut its Kenyatta Avenue branch in January, the last out of the four in the town where the chain was founded in the 1980s. “Naivas started in Nakuru and we are back to make our presence felt in the South Rift region. We intend to maintain growth plans this year with a strategic focus on underserved and high-value urban locations. Despite the impact of Covid-19 on business and the economy, we remain resilient in our expansion strategy,” said Naivas’ chief commercial officer Willy Kimani. Mr Kimani recalled that former chairman and the founder of Naivas, Peter Mukuha Kago, had wanted to have a branch at the heart of Nakuru town, but was not lucky. “I am happy his wishes have been fulfilled today. The outlet will be stocked with a variety of quality products to choose from, ranging from fresh produce, branded food, general household items, electronics among many others,” he added. The new Naivas branch raises competition in Nakuru where last week Cleanshelf opened its first outlet on the same street. Other retailers in the town include WoolMart and QuickMart with two branches each while homegrown Gilanis has maintained its only branch. Naivas Supermarkets began as a family shop known as Rongai Self Service Stores in a tiny village at Rongai trading centre on the fringes of Nakuru town in the early 1990s. It has since grown to become a major player in the fiercely competitive retail business in Kenya. Naivas took over the premises vacated by Nakumatt at the Nakuru West Side mall in 2019.
